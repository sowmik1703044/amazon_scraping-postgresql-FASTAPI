Brand: Casio Men's Vintage F91W-1 Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch, Model: Casio Men's Vintage F91W-1 Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch, Price: 16, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: This watch is perfect. It is super compact, super durable, super simple, and it costs as much as a fast food meal. It is the most sold non smart watch ever. If you need a watch and don’t need it to connect to your phone, there is literally no reason to buy any other watch, unless you are one of those weirdos that are obsessed with how watches look. It is also super intuitive and easy to use, and the alarm function works great as well. It has 7 years of battery life, which, at a $20 price point is less than one cent per day to always know the time, have a stopwatch, and have an alarm. At night, the light works great, and during the day, it is easily readable. I’ve already bought this watch twice, and I just got it again for an upcoming trip where I won’t have my phone. However, I’ve realized that having a watch is just better. Instead of fishing around in your pocket and getting sucked into YouTube, you can just glance at your wrist. Smart watches are dumb and gimmicky. Dumb watches are the way to go, and this is the best dumb watch out there. And if you are even considering buying an analog watch I genuinely don’t know how to help you. Can your analog watch set timers, have a 24 hour clock, have a stopwatch, or be super precise? I didn’t think so. And this watch is waterproof too.Read more by M. Sharp, Simple watch for a very low price but gets the job done. Fits and feels nice on the wrist with a retro look. Shows time digitally and has a built in stopwatch and alarm features.Read more by William Greene, I love this watch because of its simplicity. I consider this watch to be utilitarian and perfect for anyone who works with their hands, outdoor laborious work; basically a tradesman’s watch. It is basically the same watch from many years ago introduced by Casio that started the digital watch revolution. Its old style uniqueness is a conversation starter as well. The price and watch is such that you can put it through the wringer and not worry or feel bad about it. It certainly will hold up to whatever you throw at it. Yes, it’s small, the band could be better, but it’s actually just perfect how it is and what it is for. I love this watch and it makes me smile every time I look at it - a sort of nostalgic simplicity that is just there, kind of like a reliable friend. Great watch, but know your expectations and requirements before ordering to make sure it will be what you want.Read more by IT Gal, Its durable, accurate timekeeping, and inexpensive. The strap is way shorter than other casios/gshocks, so you cannot do that thing where you leave the clasp at the lowest hole so you can put on the watch and tighten it with one hand without looking. The resin kinda sucks compared to other casios/gshocks, but if you get it on sale (DONT buy this full price) its a good value. If this is at full price, id just get the gshock on amazon for like 40-50 bucks.Read more by Isaac De Silva, A lot of products I used to love have gone notably down in quality over the past few years. Not this one. The price is a bit higher but it's worth the buy. One watch lasts me at least three years of continuous use with no battery change (I haven't tried for longer so it may go longer than that still). I've never had any problems to speak of with these- they stand up to grime, wear and tear, jostling, and water up to a reasonable level (they're not meant to be submersed, but have survived my forgetting to take them off when jumping in the pool, ocean, or shower multiple times, and have never gotten damage from rain or splashes). Easy to clean, easy to take on and off. I have a bad metal allergy to some mental and have never had any issue with this watch, and the band is a soft rubber that resists chafing. 11/10 would recommend.Read more by Spiffy McPerson.

Reviews: I just received the Casio world time digital.  Very handsome and practical.  Watch feels comfortable and light but sturdy and well made.  (Case is plastic but bracelet is stainless.But case matches stainless well.) The digital display is large enough to read the time but the date image is rather small.  The analog display is not that useful but a nice-to-have. Setting the time and date is rather straight forward as it's similar to the GShocks.  Timekeeping seems accurate based on comparison with my phone's clock.  The bracelet feels very comfortable on my average size wrist.  Bracelet link adjustment is a chore as it requires fine manual dexterity and finger strength to manage the fold-over links.  The watch has a retro-vintage appeal and appearance.  For $35 it is a bargain and I recommend it if you're thinking of getting a digital wristwatch.  It's a Casio; so it is well made, simple to use and affordable.Read more by Amazon Customer, It's a really nice watch. I'm surprised by the quality and how much I like it. I had to remove a few links to get the metal wrist band just right. That said it's has plenty of adgusttments to get a nice fit. Feels nice and the screen is very clear and the stainless is very attractive. It feels like far higher quality then what you pay for. I'm still playing with the various settings but it's a really neat design and I think it's perfect for anyone who enjoys traveling since you can set multiple different timezones. The back light is plenty bright too with a orange glow. It has a lot going on. I was apprehensive about a watch under 30 bucks but it's worth it. I also think the metal band is well worth the extra 10 bucks. It says 10 year battery life on the housing but I guess we'll see. Lastly as far as fashion goes, I think it's nice and versatile. It looks just as good in your casual close as it does with your work attire and your Sunday best. I also like that it reads time down to the second. It's nice to know how accurately I can set this watch. How it will preform long term, I can't say but I'm optimistic judging from what I'm seeing. Anyway, I would recommend this to a friend. Heck, I'll probably buy it again as a gift.Read more by BlazingZipper, I got this as a gift for my partner, and he really loves it! Really nice quality and I feel looks more expensive than the price! Do be aware of sizing and you may need to adjust more than just initial adjustments, a watch link repair kit may be necessary.Read more by emily, Loving this throw back. Super sharp.

Got this watch to help me with my timing as that’s something I struggle with, and it does it’s job well! I can wear it in the shower, swimming, dealing with soupy garbages, and washing dishes, so it’s definitely durable! I like being able to set alarms and adjusting the time is a simple process. The little light you can use to illuminate the time is helpful as well! I also like the size of this lil watch! Not too small, not too bulky, and easy to see! I recommend this watch!Read more by Kenyatta Fultz, Really love the look and feel of this watch. Looks and feels like a g shock. I bought it for those reasons but also because the listing on Amazon shows a countdown timer. I do not see that function in the manual or on the Casio site. I am disappointed because that is how I narrowed my Casio choice down to this one. I would’ve purchased a different one(say the world timer or ae 1300) had I known this didn’t have the timer. I am a runner and not sold on a smart watch so I was hoping to use the timer on runs. For now I’ll use as everyday casual wear and still enjoy glancing at the time on a run vs. digging for my phone. Also female with small wrists and aside from the band being a tad long I feel the 42 mil is a great fit.Read more by Lauren Outlaw.

Reviews: I have used my cell phone instead of a watch since about 2001.  Decided to start wearing cheap, quartz watches again because I often find myself without my cell phone within reach at rehearsals, recording sessions, lawn-mowing, or work from home situations. Picked up a few Timexes and Casios around the same time. So far, I like this model the best for general use. The size of the time display is so easy to read that I have already started preferring it to comparable analog models.  I will mostly be looking to buy digital watches like this with big, simple displays from now on.I’m not James Bond, in spite of what you may have heard. I don’t want an expensive watch on my wrist that might make me a potential target for theft/robbery downtown or on a subway. If I get some paint on this one or it breaks while I’m trying to remove an oil filter, it would be no great loss.Use is fairly intuitive and it hasn’t lost or gained time in the few weeks I’ve owned it, unlike a Timex expedition analog model I got at the same time. After only a couple of weeks, the analog Timex expedition has lost about ten seconds already, which I admit I was surprised by.The only complaint I could possibly make about this watch is that the two LED’s are quite poor in comparison to Timex’s indiglo or the backlight used on much more expensive G-Shock models. But for how cheap and functional this model is, that is a completely unfair comparison. The lights work perfectly fine for me to see if I wake up in the middle of the night but can’t roll/reach over to check my phone due to a sleeping dog contorting my legs at the foot of the bed. Or if I fall asleep on the couch.I have mostly avoided getting it wet up until now, but I did accidentally leave it in the bathroom with the shower running a couple of times and no condensation formed on the inside of the face at all even though there was plenty of water vapor in the room. I also leave it on when washing my hands with no ill-effects.I’m very impressed by how simple and functional this watch is. These cheap, digitals are light years ahead of the Timex Ironman I owned as a kid. But it should be said- that $25-$35 Ironman I bought sometime around 1995 went body boarding, surfing, in the pool with me, and I showered with it on. That thing was basically water-PROOF and never had an issue in water less than 20ft. deep. I swam in Atlantic/East-Coast hurricanes with that thing and it even got tossed around in the salty surf with me. Also used it to time lap-swimming in Olympic-sized pools. I do not have the same confidence in this model, though I have no real rationale for that.The rubber strap was very uncomfortable on the old Ironman models and used to cause some really annoying, visible, skin irritation. I found G-shock straps of that era to be almost just as bad. That is not the case with these modern Casio polymer straps.I also despise those weird circles Casio, Armitron, etc. put on watch faces and take up a quarter of the face of the watch. This watch has NONE of that BS going on. The info on the watch face is SO bold and easy to read that I would definitely prefer it to all the G-shocks with those damned, senseless circles taking up so much of the display. PV cells excluded because they actually do serve a purpose. But here’s my view on all that: if the watch battery lasts even close to ten years, it will already outlast the battery/operation of the solar-powered, $150 G-Shock I once owned by a factor of YEARS. So I would still prefer this because legibility is far more important to me than photovoltaics.After a few weeks getting used to wearing a watch again for the first time in twenty years, I’ve really appreciated not having to dig my cell phone out of my pocket just to check the time/date. A weirdly subtle difference I would never have thought would matter.  But it does. I’m starting to really like Casios!I also like the hourly chime because otherwise I get lost and completely lose track of time while recording/producing. That could only backfire if the chime goes off in the vocal booth and ruins a take. Hasn’t happened yet, though.I’m also glad they make it in the desert-sand/beige color because I’m fair skinned so it doesn’t look like a giant thing on my wrist.At some point or other I will wake up exhausted and forget to take it off before I get in the shower. At that point I will update this review if water penetrates the buttons/gaskets/seals.Again, I am in disbelief at how excellent this watch is for the price. I hope they never discontinue this model until an identical “20 Year Battery” model is available.  But by then we’ll no doubt have flying cars, rocket-skates, jet packs, and digital, tattooed watches with veinous, indiglo epidermis.  Or more than the current, standard-issue, two to three computer chips implanted into in our visual cortex at birth.Just pick the color you like and buy the damned thing!Read more by Dru Ha, This is a great digital watch with a very large and easy to read display.It’s a Casio, so you know that it’s rugged and reliable.In fact, it keeps better time than watches costing thousands of dollars.The watch isn’t big on features but I really only need it for telling time .It has an outstanding price too and since it’s a Casio I expect that it will provide many years of excellent service.I have several at her Casio watches including expensive G-Shock models.The G’s are cool and they look great but I really don’t need all of their features.Also, those big watches  can be heavy and cumbersome on your wrist.Plus, this is the easiest to read Casio I have ever seen.If I could only have a single Casio watch, this is the one I’d pick.Highly, highly recommended .Read more by JRC, I like watches. I have an Apple Watch and another stainless steel “dress” watch.I wanted a watch I could wear when working out, or doing something physical that wasn’t going to buzz at me every 8 seconds and tell me what a good boy I was for taking 5 steps and remind me to breathe.Also, I think Apple Watches are great, but they’re a little bloated with useless features that, at the end of the day, I’ve never really used.I wanted something simple, easy to read, and able to take a beating. I wanted basic tactical features (like dual time zones, stop watch, alarms, timer, a clear second display, a light)This watch is easily comparable to the “G-Shock”.Not only does it do everything I want it to do, it looks incredible. It’s very stylish. Very clear, easy to read display at a glance and it fits great (I’m a guy, 5’7” with a small wrist circumference and got the “standard” size)I’ve tested the display light in the dark and it works great. Easily readable.Build quality seems excellent. Seems to be sturdy and durable. Doesn’t feel or look cheap by any means.Haven’t tested the water resistance yet but I don’t doubt it’s going to be fine.And finally, the price. The price is unbelievable for what you get. For the $20-25 price point you get way more features and value than you’d expect.Highly recommend!Read more by Lissy, I love Casio watches. They are tough, a good value and easy to read. I have had a few over the years. The battery life is ridiculously long. I have never had one die. The band is usually the first to go. I like this model because the band is made of a much stronger composite. However, the buckle is made of…. plastic. Why? Every other Casio I have owned had a metal buckle. Once the holes wear out that the pin sits in, it will pop off when horizontal pressure is applied. This is a high contact point on a watch so making out of plastic was not a good idea.Read more by Jeremy, I wear it to bed. So when I wake up I know the timeRead more by Mitch.
Brand: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Model: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Price: 36, Material: Leather - Calfskin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: This was a gift for my father. He wanted an easy to read analog watch with day and date. Timex hit this one out of the park. It checked all boxes and has a great leather band. My Dad said it was easy to set up and "it is just the right size, not like those huge watches these days." So this was a win!Read more by ToddK, As a nurse, I have worn a Timex like this for years!! I like the quality, the size of the watch face & basic black numbers, with black clock arms. The indiglo light is perfect for seeing time in the dark. The band is comfortable. As a female, the watch looks stylish enough. I used to buy the yellow gold but have now retired and my hair is whitish grey so my choice now is the silver trim and I will continue to buy the Timex easy read watches.Read more by SLG, I wanted an analog watch for a long time and I’m so glad that my first choice, this watch, met my needs and my expectations. I am a woman but I’m using a man’s watch. It is sturdy. It is easy to read. It works. People ask if it’s a smart watch and I said no, it’s an analog watch, but I’m smart to have bought  it.Read more by EFW, I got it for my 75 yr old dad who thinks my obsession with watches is weird, but I love finding high value per dollar in ultra affordable watches too. My dad is frugal and likes that in his gifts, but low price doesn't have to mean junk. Also, he finds digitals tacky (so all the good low-end Casios were a no go).I found this Timex, "scratch & dent" on Amazon for just shy of $20, it arrived with  the box all beat up, the leather strap was not attached, and there were no spring bars. Still, the watch and strap were in brand new shape. I keep spare spring bars and it was easy to pop the strap on. Strap is on the short side, if you have larger than a 7.5" wrist, you'll probably need a different one (a NATO would work well on it, imo). Also, watch is old school size, 35mm, so it may seem small by today's standards.Highly legible day or night, it's got indiglo back light, even though that can wear on the battery if used a lot, it does look sharp in the dark, especially for this price point. Water resistant enough you don't have to worry about getting it wet, but I wouldn't go swimming or shower with it.Watch hit everything my dad likes, Timex has quality choices for a budget watch, and it was still fun for me to find. Timex is not a brand I normally look at, but dad loves it and seeing it in hand, I feel good about the purchase.I rate 4 stars because it is a lot of watch for $20-30 bucks. Though buyer beware with scratch & dent, if I didn't already have spare spring bars, I would have been irritated.Read more by merrckd, Nice look and feel.

Brand: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Model: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Price: 29, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I’m very pleased with this watch.  I’ve had it three weeks and it has been keeping good time.  I like the gold/brass color of the case and the clarity of the glass.  The face is easy to read and the cream face color is handsome and a nice contrast, less glaring than the white my previous Timex had.  Setting the date is not a problem, as some other reviews have stated.  Once you find the required “middle” position of the stem between all the way in and all the way out, it becomes pretty natural and is easy to remember.  Speaking of the date, I wish they kept the day of the week presentation that my previous Timex had, but that’s a relatively small disappointment.  The band is excellent.  It’s a soft suede-like leather that’s very flexible.  The trim stitching is very well done; straight, even,  and all finishings are secured and tucked away so that there are no loose ends or fraying looks.  The two belt loops, one fixed close behind the buckle and the other sliding further down the strap are great for keeping the strap close to the wrist.  All-in-all, a great buy for the price!Read more by KJ, Timex - hard to beat.  Watch arrived in new condition packaged in genuine plastic Timex display/packaging. A sticker on the package states: movement and assembly: Philippines, strap: China.  Regarding waterproofing, per the enclosed literature : " Is water resistant only as long as lens, buttons, and case remain intact;...is not a diver's watch (not to be used for diving );...and the caveat not to push any buttons whilst underwater. It also states 30 meter water resistance; without a screw down winding stem, I would be skeptical of that claim and I personally won't be submerging this particular watch.The watch strap is stamped "genuine leather upper"; appears to be good quality, stitched well and blemish free. Changing the date is simple: pull the stem out about less than midway and turn- left or right - until the desired date  is shown and push stem back in. The date window is not magnified and quite small, but the date is readable. There is an audible ticking sound. However, my hearing isn't all that hot anymore and I need to put it next to my ear to hear it.The whole watch is fairly light, not like an auto winding Swiss chronograph. The numerals and the hands are black and contrast well against the watch face, the second sweep hand is gold colored. Pushing the stem in activates the Indiglo feature: the watch face is backlight and the numerals and hands are boldly and easily readable.Someone asked if this a knockoff because it is so inexpensive; the Red Bull'seye Store sells the same watch for exactly the same price as on this site. These modest Timex watches are fairly inexpensive and this is no exception.So, if you are looking for an easy to read watch, night or day, doesn't cost too much offered by a brand that has been around since 1854,  and has a certain understated style, you might want to consider the Easy Reader watch collection line.Read more by Amazon Customer, Love my watch!  Nice look and easy to read day or night.Read more by Dennis Rutledge, I'm hard on watches as I use them for work.  They happen to get rough treatment.  I look to watches that have a crystal face to prevent scratches, and the comfort of a leather band, and easy to read in day or night.  This is not an heirloom watch, but it does just what I want it to do.  My only complaint, which is pretty must  across all brands, is the date is difficult to read anytime the lighting is low.  But if I run this watch through a wood chipper or rip it off my wrist on a rock...I won't cry of lose sleep over it.Read more by Jim H7uy, I've worn this style of Timex watches for many years & recently lost the one I had so I ordered a new one. I got this men's version for a more casual look & it came in the same day I found the old watch tucked down in the sofa cushions where the CAT hangs out. She stole my glitter!I love the larger face on the men's version without it being too large &, if I'm wearing a watch, it HAS to have Indiglo. It's been the most dependable watch I've come across for everyday wear & looks sleek & timeless, day to night.Read more by JojoB.
Brand: Casio Men's Vintage A158WA-1 Water Resistant Digital Watch, Model: Casio Men's Vintage A158WA-1 Water Resistant Digital Watch, Price: 20, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Ha. This is a watch of contradictions. Cheap, yet well-made. Small, but noticeable. Old, but it feels so damn new. The watch performs flawlessly and despite mentions of it being retro, it is slick, modern, and even better looking in person.I will say, however, that I found the included contract unusual and potentially disturbing. When I placed the order, a prompt I’d never seen before appeared, inviting me to read and sign a contract. The document stated rather explicitly that the watch was for “handsome guys” and that I would not be permitted to wear it if I was a “major uggo”. Whatever. I signed the contract and placed the order. What happened next was the truly unexpected...Two days after placing the order, I received a knock on my door very late at night. I wish I could tell you what time it was, but I did not yet own the watch so it is impossible to say. I peered through my peephole and saw the figure of a tall man in a long coat. Slowly, I opened the door and asked him what he wanted. It’s then I noticed a wristwatch with the largest band I’d ever seen wrapped around his forehead. It was analog, so I couldn’t tell the time. The man introduced himself in a voice so quiet his words were almost drowned out by the ticking of his pretentious headwatch. “I’m with Casio,” he says. Or maybe “Dime sith mass E oh”. Hard to say. Still confused, I asked him again what he wanted. It was then that things took a turn for the worse.Uninvited, he stepped into my home and grabbed my face with his cold, dry, watch-tuning fingers. I tried to resist and found my body unresponsive. I’ve later theorized that his stupid, unreadable headwatch was in some way hypnotic and temporarily robbed me of my senses. By the dim porch light, he jerked my head around, carefully but methodically inspecting every angle of my face. It obviously wasn’t the first time he’d conducted this sick facial analysis.Suddenly, he stopped. With me still immobile and deathly frightened, he took a step back, gave me one final, fleeting check and muttered “Acceptable. Seven out of ten.” Having said this, he promptly tapped the dial on his gaudy headwatch and I fell to the ground, exhausted and overwhelmed by my experience, but released from his spell.The next thing I knew, it was morning and someone was calling for me. “Sir? Sir? Are you okay?” I looked up and saw my door was agape and the mail person stood above me, package in hand. Embarrassed to have been defeated by the mysterious man and his unfashionable watch, I simply nodded and began to stand. Obviously unsettled, the mail person handed me the package as I rose and told me to have a good day. It was my watch! And boy, what a watch it is!The moral of the story is this: the watch is incredible, and at $20 perhaps the finest entry-level watch money can buy.However, potential buyer, I caution you this: if you are any less than a 6.5 or 7 out of 10, don’t kid yourself. Perhaps you’ve got more a F91W or G-Shock type of face, and that’s nothing to feel bad about. Not everyone can be handsome! Just be careful - I’ve heard the watchman and his hideous headwatch do not look kindly upon the unattractive.Read more by Customer, It’s a classic digital watch. Stylish, light weight, affordable. Can’t be it.Read more by Cliff, I got the watch because I wanted to be able to have a digital clock with the second counter while I was at work. I have an apple watch but sometimes want to wear just a simple watch. The silver is a perfect color and hasn’t tarnished or anything for the time i’ve had it. The instructions were easy to use for setup but there was no instructions on how to adjust the size of the watch which was odd because it isn’t that obvious to figure out. After a short google search I was able to resize it fairly easy. I like that it shows the date information as well as it having a light for low light situations. I love the watch and can see it becoming my daily watch as it is very stylish too.Read more by John Taylor, Looks good on the wrist, tells you time, day and date of the month.

I bought this just to wear with some outfits and change up from my other watches.Pros: Easy to setup, easy to read in general lighting, easy to adjust band size on the fly without any tools. In my opinion, I don't think this specific style will ever not go with just a simple "day out" outfit. If you're a little exhausted of smart watches like I am, this can offer some reprieve- the features this has is standard digital watch features, but work really well.Cons: The light on this model has always been mediocre- If you are using your watch in a dark environment consistently, be mindful of that. It seems to only shine from the left side of the face, and can be hard to read. If you're a guy with arm hair, the default band seems to grab and pull a little more than other bands. Speaking of the band, if you have broader wrist/arms, this band and face may look a little out of place with how small they are.Overall, it's hard to beat the price point for the style of watch you're getting. They seem to last quite awhile as well. A great budget beginner watch to jump start a collection with.Read more by Michael Bridges.
Brand: SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 6 44mm Bluetooth Smartwatch, Fitness Tracker, Personalized HR Zones, Advanced Sleep Coaching, Heart Monitor, BIA Sensor, Health Wellness Insights, Big Screen, US Version, Graphite, Model: SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 6 44mm Bluetooth Smartwatch, Fitness Tracker, Personalized HR Zones, Advanced Sleep Coaching, Heart Monitor, BIA Sensor, Health Wellness Insights, Big Screen, US Version, Graphite, Price: 189, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Coming from being an apple user and making the switch to android, this watch thus far is superior in almost every way in comparison. From the screen pixelation to sound quality to vibration intensity to superior app integrated. The samsung watch offers a variety of superior features which I think is definitely enticing enough for the switch. Coming from the apple watch it had the basics, the message replies, calls, apple pay, a few mediation and breathing apps, remote phone camera click and an ECG app that never worked. With the Samsung Galaxy watch 6 you're definitely getting better value per buck, you can use Google maps, a semi small but functional google web browser, a watch that measures your stress, gives you a decent review of how you slept from body temperature, heart rate and the cycles of sleep from rem to awake, a customizable watch face, Gmail, YouTube music, various work out apps, fitness and calorie tracking apps, games, a variety of music listening apps, etc. The only necessary cons I would mention about this watch is the voice to text feature isn't quite as consistent or picks up words correctly and the battery life is definitely a little short then my previous apple watch and the band that it comes with for us petite people is horrendous; I had it on the smallest hook and it was still about 3 inches above my wrist and would slide down, thankfully I bought a replacement band that is much better, however I would say for the value, quality and features this the watch to go.Read more by Trinity, Got it used and it's in great condition.I've only ever had fitbits in the past, and this is really nice in comparison. Especially since I have a Samsung phone. Set up was a breeze.The battery does drain after about 24hr,  if you're using the more advanced tracking capabilities. But I just charge it every morning while I'm showering. It charges extremely fast.I love the level of customization, and especially like that it automatically has everything from my phone connected, including my calendar and text messages. Very useful for my adhd forgetfulness. Even with reminders set in my phone, I still often miss them. This watch is always connected to my wrist, even if my phone is on silent or not on me, my watch always buzzes and let's me know. I've missed a lot fewer things because of it.Read more by Ryn, Very light and comfortable to wear. I've enjoyed using it so far and the only con this watch has is its battery life, but besides that it's an awesome smart watch.Read more by Mr.Dave, I've got a handful of pointers regarding this watch that you might heed before buying it.  That being said, I love the thing as of a few months owning it.Pros:1. The watch has many functions for health monitoring and is top of its class in that regard.2. It has the perfect sized face on it, not small at all but not too big.3. It feels sturdy all around, glass included.4. The amount of great digital faces available for free and for purchase (typically $1-$2 only) is awesome.5. It does GPS tracking for hiking and mountain bike rides that is used to display your path/location on a map in the Samsung Health app at the end of a workout, so you don't need to pay some obnoxious subscription for a 3rd party app like Strava to track that.6. Given that my last watch, a FitBit Sense, literally corroded and burned my wrist skin at the battery contact points, I'm all for the new non-electrical / "wireless" (magnetic) charging functionality of this one and will promote that as a reason to get one.Cons:1. It is hard to dial in the best watchband length/size with spare links. You either get it too loose and then the sensors don't work well (way inaccurate heart rate readings during workouts, lack of blood oxygen readings at night, etc), or you get it too tight and the watch clasp pops undone constantly as you go about your day or your hand circulation suffers while you're trying to sleep.  Unless you don't mind adjusting the links on your band twice per day or more (even in the middle of the night since everyone's wrists expand as we sleep), it might be best to go with a synthetic, flexible band that you can switch out to for when you're not dressed nicely on an outing or something (the band does at least look good).  I have done this and it is way easier to wear now.2. Bixby seems to randomly activate, which takes over your screen with her icon and a note that says "Listening". You have to swipe or push buttons to close out of this prompt every time it happens.3. Sometimes there is a delayed response time when switching activities on the watch such as going from your clock face to starting a biking workout, and it feels clunky.4. Randomly vibrates, often twice or three times within a 5 second period, without any notification on the screen as to why.5. When starting a hike in the watch OS, it seems to possibly take your last known elevation and then add whatever the difference is between that and your starting elevation, and it claims you've climbed that height within the workout you are doing at the moment, which is entirely erroneous.  That's what I want to believe it is doing, anyway - it could just be super glitchy and thinks you are actually thousands of feet higher than you really are at some point during the workout, due to satellite connectivity or data or something strange, and just jumps your workout to having done that kind of climb.6. The battery lasts about half as long as my FitBit Sense did prior to this, for some reason, despite having the face set to not be always on.7. The blood oxygen saturation sensor must have some kind of weak detector or can't record information when the watch is loosened up for sleep time (to prevent tightening during the night when our wrists swell a bit), because there are typically many gaps in the O2 data on the nightly chart.Takeaway:The watch is well worth it if it is on a good sale, so long as you know that it's not perfect (which the regular price would seem to indicate).Read more by A. Bombac, I recently upgraded to the Samsung Watch 6, finally replacing my old Samsung Gear, and I couldn’t be happier! The design is sleek, modern, and fits perfectly on my wrist. It’s a huge improvement in both style and comfort, making it a great accessory that I can wear all day.But what really stands out is the functionality. It seamlessly integrates with my phone, keeping me connected with notifications, calls, and messages. The health tracking features are more advanced than ever, and I love how user-friendly the interface is. Whether it’s tracking my steps, monitoring my heart rate, or even using the GPS during walks with my dog, Kobe, the Samsung Watch 6 has become an essential part of my daily routine.Overall, I’m loving the upgrade! It’s the perfect blend of looks and functionality, and I’m glad I made the switch.Read more by tracey somsouk.
Brand: Fossil Grant Men's Watch with Chronograph or Automatic Display and Genuine Leather or Stainless Steel Band, Model: Fossil Grant Men's Watch with Chronograph or Automatic Display and Genuine Leather or Stainless Steel Band, Price: 124, Material: Calfskin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I purchased the Fossil Grant Men’s watch with a chronograph display for my significant other, and it has quickly become his favorite accessory. From its classic design to its impressive functionality, this watch is truly a standout piece.The first thing that caught my eye was the stunning dial, which adds a unique and stylish touch to the traditional Grant design. It’s the perfect balance of elegance and modernity, making it suitable for any occasion.The chronograph display not only adds a practical element to the watch but also gives it a sporty edge that my significant other loves. Whether he’s timing laps at the track or simply keeping track of the time during a busy day, the chronograph feature comes in handy.The quality of the watch is evident in every detail, from the durable stainless steel case to the comfortable blue leather strap. It feels substantial on the wrist without being too heavy, and the craftsmanship is top-notch.But perhaps the best part of all is seeing the smile on my significant other’s face whenever he wears this watch. It’s clear that he truly loves it, and that’s the best endorsement I could ask for.Overall, I highly recommend the Fossil Grant Men’s watch to anyone in search of a stylish and reliable timepiece. Whether you’re buying it for yourself or as a gift for someone special, you can’t go wrong with this beautiful watch.Read more by Rumana, Beautiful watch and great quality!

He is still wearing it everyday. Works great!!Read more by Sunysmiles, I’m not new to mechanical watches. I have Seiko, Orient and other reputed watches .This one has really impressed me with the open heart skeletal design , and the movement is gorgeous to look at (it’s a Seiko commercial  Japan movement ) … It’s keeping good time and lasted more than 40 hours when rested (as claimed ).Only negative at this price point is the quality of the leather strap - Fossil skimped on the quality here. But you can always buy a 22mm strap from them or other third party.  Overall quite happy with the purchase.Read more by Amitava Das, Just a good basic watch. Pretty versatile, could wear semi-casual with a button up shirt, to business formal with a suit. Nothing too fancy, but decent quality for the sale price. I paid $65 for the black band and bought another one with the brown band for $75. Fair prices, I wouldn’t pay more for that with this one. And they are different enough that it’s not the exact same watch with different bands either, the dial is not the same between the different variations, which is goodOnly drawback is it’s a little boring, but boring isn’t always bad. If you don’t want your watch to domineer your outfit and you’re not necessarily trying to make a bold statement or stand out all that much this is a nice one. It’s not cheap looking,  but won’t wow anyone either. Just a nice respectable basic watch for different occasionsRead more by JayBird23.

The watch is very attractive I highly recommend.Read more by Amazon Customer, Classy brown color that I've worn casually and formally. Fossil, you're amazing!Read more by Zachary Hall, I bought this watch two years ago almost to the day (October 18th 2021), and this past week after going strong for two yeas straight with not problems the Crystal fell off! The movement is still in good working order and the body and band have held together with me wearing this watch almost every day. I don't know why the crystal fell out, but it did it without warning. Watch was under warranty, but the crystal is not covered??? $40 including shipping if I have Fossil fix it, which is much less then the watch, just a little frustrating. Over all though I'd say i probably had a fluke. In general the watch looks nice, holds up well, keeps good time, and if you get the leather band is comfortable to wear. The hands do glow in the dark, but not very bright, unless it sits in direct light for a bit. Over all a good watch, just expect some expense to maintain it somewhere along the way.Read more by Nathan.
Brand: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch – Leather Strap, Model: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch – Leather Strap, Price: 37, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Just got it in today. Looks and feels great. I will post in the future on any updates. The watch looks and feels very well made.  It’s not too heavy, and easily read. The Date window is pretty small. The watch band is very comfortable and seems durable. I absolutely Love the Luminous button, which looks great in low and dark lighting. This watch is the 40mm case size, which is the smallest watch I’ve ever owned. I have always bought much larger watches, i.e. 46mm and larger. So I am still getting used to the smaller watch, but it still is a great size. I’ve done a ton of research, and bought many watches, so this one seemed to have a lot of great reviews.  I will update my review, whether good or bad, in the future. Because I know how hard it is to find a good watch, for a decent price nowadays. So far, songoodRead more by Jody Lampin, There's a lot to be happy about with this watch.  It's got a nice weight, the color scheme (especially the orange second hand) is gorgeous.  The case is a brushed grey, a little lighter than gunmetal.  Simple and sleek! Can't remember the last time I had a watch with indiglo - love that! The watch brand seems like a decent quality leather band - it does take time to break in though, which I'd expect will lend to durability long term.Only minor downside is the lume on the hour/min hands is pretty weak.  But doesn't seem all that necessary when you have the indiglo lighting up the dial in low light.Time and Date setting was a breeze - pretty standard for anything with a crown.Read more by Stephen Korthals, Overall it's a very decent watch and I am satisfied with it, considering the price (I bought it on sale for around $45). I'm a little surprised that even my wife has mentioned a couple of times that it's a nice looking watch. Don't get me wrong, no one will mistake it for a $300 watch but I like how it looks and that's good enough for me. I wanted an inexpensive daily watch with Arabic numerals, easy to read and not too cluttered, with a little bit of field watch look and this watch met the need. For comparison's sake, the other option I was considering was a Seiko 5 field type watch, which would be fine but also at least 3 times more expensive and I didn't want another Japanese watch, I already have a Citizen Promaster so I'm good on that score and I didn't feel like coughing up a few hundred bucks for a Swiss automatic movement. I'll list my pros and cons and make it short:Pros:- good looking face, large Arabic numerals- size is about right for my personal taste, I don't like larger diameter watches but some people do- light weight was moderately important to me- accuracy, telling the time accurately is a watch's reason for being, and I think this is plenty accurate, about the same my Citizen Promaster or even a little tighter, really, but I'm not such an important person as to worry about a couple of seconds off here and there- solar, so no battery changes to fool around with the Expedition Solar version I purchasedCons: I don't have any strong negative opinions for this watch, particularly considering the price bracket we are in, but I will say- the lume is a little on the weak side, it doesn't last very long in my opinion so it would be hard to read at night or in a dark environment- height, I could wish it were a little thinner, it's not terrible but I just feel it sits a little taller than it has a right toTo sum it up again, it's very decent watch and I would give it 4 and 1/2 starsRead more by Harry GjonPlissken, Once you set the time on this, you make never interact with it again other than looking at it. It's solar. The tiniest bit of light keeps it going. There's nothing to break or go wrong. It's great looking and matches any outfit. It's waterproof. It's great looking, and versatile. You should still probably get a Casio Duro if you want a simple watch, but this is the same kind of thing but solar.Read more by Not S. A. Wilson, Yes, I'm old enough to remember the time revered motto of Timex. I ordered this watch for my daily wear watch to replace my 1930s Stuart.

Simple, Rugged and easy to read with luminous hands and the indiglo backlighting for night time viewing.Read more by Pendragon.
Brand: Anne Klein Women's Bracelet Watch, Model: Anne Klein Women's Bracelet Watch, Price: 28, Material: Stainless Steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Cute watch, I love the colors. I believe it’s water resistant, and I turn it off when I’m not using it to preserve the time retention. The battery seems to be holding up nicely. Pretty easy to read. This would be a great gift value! The size is a nice loose fit on me just how I like it.  Functional as well.Read more by Leslie, Most of the rectangular/boxy watches I’ve searched are either pricey or have quality issue. Then I came across to this. The size is perfect. I just removed the extra lock link and voila! It fits perfectly to my wrist. It was inside a box and carefully packed when I received it. And it is affordable. Now, I’m crossing my fingers that this watch will last.Read more by Raymond S Rollon, Gorgeous watch, especially for the price!! I receive so many compliments on it everyday and it is so comfortable that I often do not even take it off at night. I even accidentally wore it into a hot tub for about 30 minutes or so and had no issues with any water damage!There have only been 2 issues/downsides that I have experienced along the way: the first would be that I received damaged watches twice (did a return and repurchased 3 times) before receiving one that was in perfect condition on the 3rd try. So while I am very happy with my purchase now, just know that it may take a few tries to get your hands on a good/new quality one. The second disclaimer would be that the pins are SO DIFFICULT to remove. Much harder than any other watch I’ve adjusted in the past. You have to apply so much force which unfortunately makes the pins and sides of the links so easy to become damaged/scratched. Once removed for the first time though, the pins become SO easy to take out/put back, so I’m glad that I went through the effort to do so!If you can get through the difficulty of purchasing and adjusting, the watch is SO WORTH IT! Everyone asks where I bought it because it is so dainty and stunning! Definitely would buy again!Read more by Rebekah Tom, I bought the gold to use with my bracelets for fashion. Haven’t worn watch for few years. I love it. I love the skinny face look so I can stack with bracelets. Great quality price point. Only thing for me is that it is a little hard to undo the clasp when taking off. Will take couple tries using my nails to undo clasp. But at least I know it won’t come off. I did also come back and buy the two tone gold and silver for when I wear silver jewelry.Read more by ms.kat, I bought this watch on amazon prime day and the quality for the price is astounding. The watch itself is very cute. I have smaller wrists and the watch doesn't look too big on them. You can adjust the band to fit your wrist perfectly. I've hit the surface of the watch and I've worn it while sweating but the surface hasn't scratched nor has the gold started to discolor! I would definitely recommend.Read more by Samantha Fulgium.
Brand: Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200 M WR Black Dive Watch (MDV106-1A), Model: Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200 M WR Black Dive Watch (MDV106-1A), Price: 52, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: As my eyesight gets worse with age, I was looking for a durable, waterproof, easy-to-read watch with a simple timer that looked great on my wrist.  I own both a Fitbit and Apple watch – I was getting tired of being tracked all the time and getting notifications about everything (which yes, I know can be adjusted).  I’ve owned Casio watches before and still have a G-Shock digital that’s been running great for almost 20 years, so after reading many reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, it was an easy decision to make.I went with the black face and bezel model, although you really can’t go wrong with any of the other colors offered.  It’s a classic diving watch that, in my opinion, looks sturdy, cleaner and more elegant than some of the more expensive competitors.  Given Casio’s proven durability over the decades and the price point of this particular watch, you can't miss with this one.There are a ton of You Tube videos and review articles online about this diver (which is a bit of a cult classic it seems) – the vast majority of which are overwhelmingly positive, so I won’t add much more here that hasn’t already been stated there.  One common “complaint” that I noticed though is regarding the stock watchband.  Many are critical of it, but I tend to disagree.I did take the advice of some and tried a few different aftermarket bands – the Barton elite silicone, a Ritchie classic leather band, and a Ritchie nylon NATO strap (all available on Amazon).  With the exception of the NATO, I personally found the stock Casio diver band the watch comes with to be the most comfortable of the others tried – not taking away from or knocking the others by any means, it’s just a “why spend the extra money” type thing for a $50-ish watch.  Simply a personal thing…Re the NATO strap in my pics:  I did keep the Ritchie Premium Nylon strap to compliment the watch.  It really does dress it up and make the timepiece pop for more “formal” occasions if you will – and very comfortable too.  For everyday use though, the stock classic diver-style band turned out to be the most practical for me – one I recommend over aftermarket options and especially for those in the trades or who are knocking around on the beach, out hunting, at the lake, etc.If I had to be critical of any aspect of this watch, it would be the luminescent capacity of the hands and markers – something also frequently mentioned in many of the reviews I read online.  It’s marginal at best.  When blasted with high intensity light, the markers glow brilliantly initially, but it does seem to fade quick.  I mention it because if this is an important feature for you night owls, it is something to consider. For me, it’s acceptable and not enough of a factor for me to change my rating of the piece.Bottom line is that I highly recommend this waterproof diver.  It’s superior quality with Casio durability and reliability at a price that can’t be beat.  It keeps d***-near perfect time and doesn’t have to be charged on a daily basis or wound ever – just a simple, inexpensive battery keeps it going for a couple of years.  You will not be disappointed with this one!  Thx, DTEdit 2/2/2024:  A word on timekeeping:  Having owned this watch for a while now, it does GAIN a few seconds every month.  I go to www.time.gov to set adjust time every now and then...  It's still more accurate than my other watches though - amazing considering this is a $50-ish dollar piece.  Highly recommend this watch!Read more by VAARK, This watch, especially for the price is amazing. Time Keeping is amazingly accurate and 200m/20 atm water resistance is really good along with the screw down crown. Its not over done on the dial and is a nice purely simple diver watch with a moving bezel and date window. $57 and its a great looking watch that goes with casual or a bit more dressed up clothing. The main thing I'd recommend changing is the watch comes with a 22mm watch strap. The rubber one that comes with it is a bit cheap feeling, but its easy to change with a small flathead or correct watch toolkit as amazon sells, I had an extra nylon front/leather back (wrist side) sitting around on a watch i wasn't wearing and was same 22mm, swapped them around not only is the nylon one more comfortable, it looks better too. Images in review show the casio swapped with the other watch i swapped the bands on, the silver case is the casio with the band that came factory from the black case one with the casio factory strap, as i don't wear that particular watch as often as the casio. This casio is comfortable and very accurate as well as seeming to be very sturdily built.Read more by Kevin Matthew Spears, I wanted a weekend beater for surfing and off-road motorcycling. It had to be big-faced and easy to read at a glance. No digital crap, please. I needed another watch like a hole in the head. I have some really nice watches and I'm not a collector. But since I am single and nobody around to tell me no, I got it. Great value for the price, just an impeccable knockout of the Rolex Submariner of old that I always envied.  As soon as I got it as set the time and took it surfing.  I banged it around, held it under water, sprayed with a fire hose, took a shower with it, and just hammered it with abuse as much as I could so I could return it promptly.  No success; I could not destroy it. It still holds time to the millisecond with no fogging and no problems.  Just a big hunk of phat shiny blissful steel with black highlights, a discrete second-hand, a tight rotating bezel and a light rubber wristband.  For $37 this is a steal.  I might just hang up my Tag Heuer and Victorinox watches until this thing lets me down, which may be a while.  Very easy to read at a glance which is why I got it. Not too heavy, really shiny, Big and fat. Classic good looks.UPDATE: \December 5, 2014.\ 'still looks brand new, has not lost even 1-second of time. How can this be more accurate than my $1,500 dollar Tag Heuer???? I've worn it every day since I got it..  :) The rotating bezel is still tight, firm and crisp and you can update the calendar without stopping the second hand. This should cost a lot more.UPDATE: \October 17, 2015.\ Replaced the battery finally, Still holds the time to the millisecond and not a scratch on the bezel or the steel. Every short month I calibrate it to the atomic clock NHIST in Colorado and it has never failed to be dead nuts on. The rubber wristband and the chrome look like brand new. I have really abused this thing and it just laughs at me.UPDATE \April 6, 2016 \ The band finally gave out, I replaced it at a watch store for $10 with the exact same type. I went to set it to the atomic clock, and did not need to adjust the time at all. Right on the money; still keeping perfect time. Still looks like day 1.UPDATE \Sept 27, 2016\ I hate this watch, I'm looking for a reason not to wear it anymore, It just keeps going on and on and looking brand new. Now all my other watches have had battery death from neglect, Why did I ever buy anything else? I wear a Casio over a Rolex and can't find any reason to switch back. My VW gets the job done and my Rolls Royce sits in the garage. fooey.Update 8/16/2023 OMG, will this thing finally just die???!! No, just keeps time to the second, looking fresh as the day I bought it. I'm getting tired of seeing the same glorious glistening crystal smerking at my doubt and disbelief 🫢. I way underpaid, it way over performs.  Crap, I'm such a fickle and unappreciative 1st world funk- monkey.Read more by Bjoerk, Read many good reviews.  Was still a bit sceptical given the price point.  Well...the reviews were right.  This is a nice watch! Hands and bezel align correctly.  Finish is good.  Nice weight.  Sits well on the wrist.  Some folks don't care for the band but I like it. Given the rising cost on everything these days, what a refreshing surprise to find this much value in a purchase.  Thank you Casio!Read more by Todd Tatton, Maravilhoso ,adorei apesar do tamanho (44mm) , não parece tão grande no pulsoRead more by Fernando.

Reviews: I switch from silver to gold in my jewelry from time to time, so I wanted a gold watch when I wear gold jewelry.  This was cheap enough but still quality.  I love the large face since I'm getting older and it's harder to read small stuff.  This looks classyRead more by Kimberly Marek, Looks great. Need to have your watch link removal ready if you have smaller wrist. Comes out nice for the price!Read more by Thuy, It’s a decent watch, it fits just around my wrist comfortably. I can’t speak of the battery as I haven’t wore it yet however, the watch was already on and the plastic that covers the watch face was partly on so I can say it was a return watch. But there weren’t any bruises on the watch. It a beautiful watch and would make a good gift. Would I recommend YES I would.Read more by cj, Maybe three and a half stars. It's good for the price. There are no clocks at the workplace and it makes me uncomfortable always looking at my cell phone for the time, via the boss might think that I am playing around on the cellphone. A cheap watch is what I needed just for that purpose. It's fits perfect and I am a middle aged woman. It doesn't cause a rash or redness on the wrist which a cheap one from Walmart did and the one from Walmart stopped working after a week or two. This one seems better quality than that. And it has clear, readable numbers, which is appreciated for a quick glance. We will see how long the battery will last.Read more by Heidi Prickett, Very nice for elderly lady.

Brand: Timex Men's Ironman Classic 30 38mm Watch, Model: Timex Men's Ironman Classic 30 38mm Watch, Price: 33, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Nice watch.  Feels well built.  Good size and easy to useRead more by Mike, Looks good and is nearly indestructibleUnfortunately they do get abused and look rough and paint comes off. This is probably the 5th one i have owned. If i didn't mind a beat up looking watch, I would probably still be wearing the first or second one i bought. Mind you, battery changes are still required.Read more by Scott, I was looking for a sports watch that can also work great as a daily driver. Wouldn't even consider a G-Shocks, as I'm ex-military, and G-Shocks just remind me of the service. So... Ended up buying this little watch, and it really is much better than a G-Shock. Pros:1. The watch is 38 mm and fits perfectly on my 6.1" wrist.2. Strap is comfortable.3. Legibility is great, large readable digits.4. Has 3 alarm clocks, each with a different tone.5. Lights keep working as long as you're pressing  buttons. That means you can finish setting whatever you need, without needing to press for lights again. Lights turn off several seconds after last press.6. Buttons are large and comfortable.7. Helps me use my smartphone less, as I'm not reaching for it anymore to tell the time and set timers.8. Unused features can be completely turned off, so they don't clutter the interface.Cons-1. Alarm clock is pretty loud. But I'm a deep sleeper, and I don't completely trust it to wake me up. Maybe if I set all 3 alarms consecutively, it might wake me up.2. Rarely, the strap pinches my arm hair.3. The occasion mode is pretty useless now that we have smartphones (But can be completely turned off).Overall really impressed with this watch, all the features feel really well thought out. I would highly recommend buying.Read more by Dean, I go through alot of watches in the last 30+ years. This one seems to be the best so far. The timer is a bit tricky so I stopped using it. The light to see in the dark needs improvement by illuminating the background rather than numbers, like the good ol days. Otherwise she's a good watch and reliable.Read more by G. Berg, Second one of these I owned, thoght I lost my original so ordered another just like it. Found my original so now I have two.I used this watch extensively years ago when I was an active runner.  Found the watch easy to use for timing splits and total race times.  Easy to read and operate.  Watch band is durable.Read more by Bill.
Brand: Casio FT500WC-5BVCF Men's Forester Sport Watch with Nylon Band, Model: Casio FT500WC-5BVCF Men's Forester Sport Watch with Nylon Band, Price: 21, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Excellent price for an accurate quartz watch that does everything a field watch should do (and more). The small LED at the 6 o'clock position is plenty bright to read the dial - no more wishing that cheap luminous hands and numerals kept their luminosity in the darkness. The 24-hour numerals are a bit small but, hey, if you can't add 12 to the current time, you probably ought not worry about military time anyway. The strap is velcro, so no fussing around with a cheap pin buckle. The date? Frankly, who needs that in a field watch anyway - but, if you want to know the date, there it is for you. The off-white dial complements the black and brown of the plastic case. The resin (AKA acrylic or plastic) crystal will probably get pretty scratched as you work in the yard or hike along brushy paths, but it's pretty easily buffed out if you want to restore the clarity. Looks great with jeans or khaki for a very casual look. A great weekend watch when you've no one to impress but yourself for making such a great buy!Read more by Elliot, I have owned several “field watch” style analog watches, most recently a metal Timex Expedition, which is a handsome military style watch. While well built, the Timex is heavy. I tried this Casio model because the weight, about half of the Timex’s, was one of the lowest weights of any analog watch available on Amazon, with the exception of perhaps a Swatch or the tiny Swatch-like Casio which the Pope wears (Google that if you don’t believe me). The all plastic design is what leads to this low weight.After wearing it for three days, I can say this watch is great & exactly what I expected. Well under 40mm across, so it’s not large on my average sized wrist. Astoundingly bright light (with a really cool multi-second fade, which I’ve never seen on a watch). And again, so lightweight you’re not even aware of its presence. Some people have asked if the hands are luminous; they are not.The most puzzling thing about this watch was the strap that came with it. Very funny looking and bulky for everyday wear. The “leather” parts of the band were clearly shiny vinyl, which gave the band a cheap look. But I will say that the supplied band would probably work well for people who use the watch for camping, hiking, canoeing, etc. The band’s Velcro was very secure and easily adjustable to any lengthy and it would be quite easy to quickly put the watch over a jacket while cold weather fly fishing or something like that. Also the supplied strap seems like it would dry fast.But because I planned to wear it was an everyday non-outdoorsy watch, I wanted to switch to a NATO strap, of which I have several. Here’s where I’d caution anyone planning to switch straps as I did. Most “lug widths” on watches are *even* millimeter widths, with 18, 20 & 22 being the most common, and 20mm being the most common of all for Timexes, Seikos, Citizens, etc. This watch is a 19mm lug width. Quite unusual. Straps, NATO and otherwise, with odd widths are difficult to find, but I happened to have one (the one featured in the photo). Is this lug width issue a huge deal? No. If you wanted to switch the watch to a NATO strap, and couldn’t find a 19mm, an 18 or 20 would work (with the former showing a bit of the metal pins and the latter being a snug fit).But aside from the weird band issue — which worked out well for me — this is a perfect watch for a perfect price. Like many Casios, you’re talking about approximately $20 for a watch which will likely last years.** One final note: I can’t vouch for the accuracy of this, but one YouTube review of this watch said it has two batteries— one for the quartz movement and another for the light. If this is true, this might be a reason to just get a brand new watch when the batteries die, since replacement of two batteries could equal the cost of the watch, especially if a jeweler were to charge you $20ish for installation of the two.Read more by Ian O. Smith, I kinda regret the Velcro band, and the addition of an unfixed band loop is silly since it's Velcro.  But I wear it every day and I love its practical build and its color scheme and sweet amber fading light.Read more by John G. Drummond, I was pleasantly surprised by this sub $20 dollar watch. I purchased this watch for knocking around.However it's appearance is quite nice. The dial has a nice easy to read face that is quite bright in daylight. The led light for the dial is very bright and you won't have any problems in reading the dial using this light at night. The watch claims to be water resistant. I already had it exposed to a light rain without any problems. I particularly like the velcro band. It allows you to adjust the band to fit your wrist exactly. No more bands sliding down your wrist because the holes in the band don't quite fit! Of course the quartz movement keeps perfect time. I also like the fact that the back of the watch can be removed with a fine point phillips driver making battery replacement easier. In summation I rate this watch a good value for the money.Read more by upwasik, The media could not be loaded.This is a very simple watch. It has a crown to pull out with a fingernail. The crown has 2 detents, the 1st for the day setting which has a satisfying click for each date. The 2nd detent is for the time. When you have the watch set where you want, fully press the crown and this Casio will the hold the time as close as possible for months.It's not just a Casio, it's a Casio analog, it's a tank.The biggest reasons to love this watch are for the comfort and ease of use of the nylon and velcro strap. Also, the backlight on this watch is fantastic.My mom bought me this watch in around 2001 because my first car did not have a clock. So I kept a version of this Forester around the shifter column and kept it there for almost 4 years.That older Forester had a different backlight, which was great, but these new Foresters have an LED which is superior. They both had a "timeout/dimming" function to them that is similar and I think is unique.I love watches and especially Casio and some more "flavorful" options like data banks and G-Shocks. But this a real great simple and rugged watch. You won't be disappointed to wear this everyday or add to a collection.Read more by SpaceAgeGamer.
Brand: Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Black Resin Strap Watch, Model: Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Black Resin Strap Watch, Price: 15, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I recently bought the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch with a Black Resin Band and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. This timepiece beautifully combines simplicity with reliability.The design is classic and minimalistic, perfect for everyday wear or even for a more formal setting. The black resin band is comfortable on the wrist and feels durable enough for daily use. The analog display is clear and easy to read, making time-telling effortless.What really stands out about this watch is its reliability. Casio is known for crafting timepieces that last, and this watch is no exception. It has been keeping accurate time since the moment I started wearing it, which is crucial for me in a watch.Moreover, its water-resistant feature has proven handy in various situations, giving me peace of mind during unexpected weather changes or accidental splashes.For its affordable price, the quality and functionality of this Casio watch are outstanding. It's a fantastic value for the money and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.If you're in search of a no-nonsense, dependable watch that won't break the bank, I highly recommend considering the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch. It's a reliable companion that gets the job done while adding a touch of understated style to any outfit. Overall, a very satisfying purchase that I would gladly recommend to others.Read more by Eduardo Cuello Suazo, Seeing as I have a tendency to lose watches, I wanted to get one that wasn't too expensive. I was positively surprised to find one on Amazon that met my criteria (simple modern design, clearly legible analog dial, reputable brand) for only $10. As far as I can tell, they are cheap not because they are shoddy but simply because they are simple.The watch has a polyurethane strap, a stainless steel back, and a hard plastic front ("crystal"). According to the markings, it is assembled ("cased") in China, but the mechanism ("movement") is made in Japan. The case is a bog standard model so if you want to put on a different strap you can easily do that. The strap is quite comfortable for a plastic strap, but it's a bit on the short side. It fits around my wrist, but only barely.It's marked as "water resistant," which does not mean you should go swimming with it, but it should be able to withstand some rain or a quick shower. In my experience, if you replace the battery in watches like this it's going to take more than $10 worth of effort to get it back to being similarly water resistant, especially as far as condensation is concerned. For high-end watches it's worth having the battery replaced by somebody who knows how to properly put the waterproofing seal back in, but for a $10 watch, unless you live in Arizona and never wash your hands, you probably want to just replace the whole watch when the battery runs out.Within a day of buying this watch I actually received a compliment about my nice-looking new watch. And I agree. Casio did not attempt to make their $10 watch look like a $100 watch with chrome-plated plastic and other such gimmicks. They produced a simple design that makes the most of the low-end materials at end rather than making a feeble attempt at imitating more expensive materials. And it works.I don't expect this watch to be an heirloom any time soon, but it tells the time and it actually doesn't look half bad, all for ten bucks. Congratulations, Casio! Awesome product!Read more by J. J. Weel, This is an excellent watch, this watch is excellent when using a formal and semiformal outfit. The good thing is that this watch is a simple and classic watch, with good colors which are black and white. However I expected the watch to be a little bit bigger, it is a small watch in comparison to other watches. I have used it like 4 times and I really like it is a comfy watch and really simple. Also it comes with a really nice stand for the watch and the price is very good for this watch. In Summary its a great watch mostly for teenagers and gentleman.Read more by manuel perez, Casio have always been a fairly reliable brand, and this watch was great. I ordered it for a friend as a gift, and although it was a little small, it was quite stylish and works well. It has a bit of a retro vibe to it and looks great with many outfits. The numbers are big and easy to read.It's water resistant and comes with a battery, and I'm not sure how long the battery will last, but it's a great price.Read more by Jeffrey Lou, Good watch at reasonable price.

Reviews: I’ve been wanting a smart watch for a while now yet couldn’t justify the $200-$500 price point of an apple watch. I came across this product and with it being sub 50 bucks I thought it’s worth the risk. I got it just a couple days after ordering and once it arrived it was beyond what my expectations were. The interface is way better than I thought I’d be and has plenty of applications for anything you’d need. From the the music to the health and bpm tracker that’s accurate and the ability to send messages and make calls. The sound quality is very clear and the touch screen is super responsive. I hardly need to charge it because of how long the battery lasts and it’s neat that comes with and charged with a magnetic charger. Both wrist bands that it comes with are extremely comfortable and secure. It’s really convenient that it is waterproof so washing my hands with it on is not a problem. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an affordable smart watch with all the features of something that’s 10 times the price. I even bought one for my mom as a gift and she loves it.Read more by Andrew, This watches is cute, functional, can answer calls and can make calls via watches, receive messages, have contacts, screen can be chosen from many options . Charging fast, connecting very easily via bluetooth! Application is great! Easy to connect to iPhone, and Samsung phones we have!The price is good and affordable!I bought for me gray watches and for my husband black one! My husband and me like these wrist watches very much!Thank you!I recommend it to my friends!Read more by svetana, I was so surprised when I ordered this watch because it was an amazing price for a great quality watch. It is very comfortable to wear, and comes with extra band, and acts just like an Apple Watch. Has so many apps to use, clear to read, and charges so fast! The battery literally lasts for like three or four weeks without having to charge it again which is such a plus. Has time passer games that work really well, and is just a great watch. It also has so many free and cool watch faces of all styles on the app to choose from, which helps you customize your r30 pro better! Great fitness tracker and has endless  exercise options! The only cons to this watch is that it cannot connect to an iPad, and that it is not waterproof. Make sure to take your watch off before jumping into the pool or lake, or taking a shower. Also, Siri, receiving messages, and calling does not work when your phone is not right by you, because those features only work with Bluetooth. Overall I am very happy with this smart watch, it does its job well!Read more by S. Jennison, Overall, the watch is pretty good. It is a great Apple Watch dupe. Looks just like it. Looks wise, the watch is nice. I wear it all day and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and it’s comfortable and light enough to wear overnight. It measures my sleep well. I mainly got the watch to keep track of my health, something that it does perfectly. It keeps track of my steps, heartbeat, stress, etc. It also connected to my iPhone with no problem through Bluetooth. I have been getting all my alerts and phone calls. The battery life is also great. I’ve had the watch for about 6 days and I haven’t had to recharge it at all. I also love that I can customize the watch face and change out the watch band as it’s compatible with Apple Watch bands.The only issue I have with the watch is that sometimes it doesn’t sync well with some of the features on my phone. There are times when it displays the wrong time and/or the weather function simply doesn’t register. The other issue I have is the app that you have to download to read and keep track of your health measures. It didn’t let me put in my correct weight or birthdate when I was initially entering my information. I had to log in later to change everything, and it finally let me fix it. These issues aren’t a major problem and I am keeping the watch despite them. I am satisfied with my purchase. If there was an option to give this watch 4.5 stars, that would be my true rating.Read more by Kandice N., Setup with connecting to my phone was simple, you will get text message notifications if you are synced to your phone.  Compared to my previous smartwatch It's very lightweight given that there are no metal components, which was a plus for me.It comes interchangable with the classic rubber wrist strap or Velcro wrist strap which is my personal favorite as removal and applying is simple and fast. Battery life is as expected with majority smart watches, very long while in use and on standby.Many functions, from the basics such as heart rate, blood oxygen, step counter, weather , calculator, timer, and new for me the stress level reader also with a wide range of sports modes to choose from. Iv had this for a couple weeks now and have had no issues thus far even with the extreme heat, rain, and wind, it still works just as it did on day one. Other than the light weight weight and style comparisons, I don't see much of a difference between this smart watch and the more pricer ones. Overall worth the price and would really recommend.Read more by Trevel.

The dial is easy to read (day/night), feels solid with just the right amount of heft... I even like the wristband. I can't remember the last time I didn't feel the need to order a separate NATO style wristband for a new watch purchase (I average around 2 years per watch before something catastrophic happens). If I had to say something negative, it is a little hard to read the date. That's a common complaint with me though and not worth deducting a star over. Comes nicely packaged in it's own cloth envelope.Read more by snailmartyr.
Brand: Amazfit T-Rex 3 Rugged/Military Smart Watch 48mm, GPS (with Privacy), Offline Maps, Long Battery Life,328 Feet Water-Resistant, 170 Fitness/Sport Modes, AI, Voice Control, for Android or iPhone, Black, Model: Amazfit T-Rex 3 Rugged/Military Smart Watch 48mm, GPS (with Privacy), Offline Maps, Long Battery Life,328 Feet Water-Resistant, 170 Fitness/Sport Modes, AI, Voice Control, for Android or iPhone, Black, Price: 279, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I watched many, many reviews on many, many watches before making this decision.  Awhile back, I owned a fossil smart watch.  They are now discontinuing those.  I wanted to make the jump to something that had built in GPS (and ability for downloading offline maps) for when I am hiking in the woods on camping trips.  I also wanted accurate heart rate, and vo2 sensors.  Baromiters, altimeters, and compass are also handy.Naturally, I looked at Garmin, Samsung, even google for smart watches.  I found 3 main problems when looking at these:1) They are all very expensive for the feature set I wanted.2) They all lack the battery life I need to be safe in the woods.3) When compared side by side to the watches by Amazfit, they really weren't better enough to even come close to justifying the price.  On top of that, this battery on the Trex3 is absolutely insane!Things I was worried about concerning the Trex 3 was the size of the watch.  In the pictures I saw in reviews, the thing looked ridiculously large on a wrist.  Well, those pictures must have just been a bad angle because this thing barely larger than my wonderful old fossil smart watch.  It looks great and I won't feel like an idiot wearing it to my upcoming business conference :) .The Zepp app took a minute or two to figure out (and quite a while to download for some reason)  but it is wonderful.  Great metrics from my hikes and runs on the watch and the app.The built in gps is nearly flawless.  It both locates quickly and tracks precisely. I freakin' love it.Even the sleep tracking this first week seemed pretty damn accurate.  That was a real shock and we'll see if it continues, but I am hopeful.The free watch faces to choose from are all cool and range from tacticool to business casual cool to Harvey in Suits cool.The watch band (mine was the red one and the Trex3 comes with it, a liquid silicone band) is SOOO comfortable. The watch feels light on my wrist.  I may swap this band out for a 22mm leather one from my fossil for the upcoming business conference. (the Trex3 comes with an adapter for the quick release watch bands we all know and love).A very long time ago (i think about 5 or 6 years ago) I bought a cheap Amazfit fitness tracker watch  that cost like 50 bucks.  It was just OK.  Not great, and the app kinda sucked.  My lord, I had no idea just how far this innovative company has come.  Their whole line of watches since then look pretty damn good.  And this rugged Trex3?  It's my dream come true.  Worth every penny so far.  For $270 bucks? Just get it.  Garmin and Samsung won't miss your $700 investment in their products.  And you won't miss a beat.  Or their vastly inferior battery life.Read more by Danny McKeever, As a Garmin Enduro2 owner, I wanted something smaller, lighter, and brighter for everyday use.  This watch, at 1/4 the price of the current Fenix lineup, leaves me little need to go back to my Enduro2 at all.  It is much more comfortable on the wrist, has superb battery stamina, excellent GPS accuracy, and is very well built, even if it lacks the titanium and sapphire glass of the Enduro. The only feature I really miss is the dedicated flashlight.  But the screen on the T-Rex 3, at 2000 nits, does a respectable job there as well.  And it is bright enough to be easily legible in direct sunlight.Highly recommended.Read more by Philly Steve, This new watch has a cool look and great function.I love the downloadable map. I go hiking often so it is very helpful especially in the outdoor when I have no signal. I can still find direction easily.I also love the training section as well. There are many different types of sports/workout I can choose from and each training would have its measurement preset in the watch to measure various results. After the workout, I can read the result and details on my app. The data shows in graph, it is very easy to read and see the trend. I can also adjust my goal based on the result.There are also many other mini programs I can download to the app. For example, yoga and stretch courses, diet monitoring, pill reminder, and many more watch faces. Overall experience with the app and the watch is nice. It is very easy to navigate. The touch screen is sensing well too.The package is nice. The watch and all the accessories are packed in one small quality box nicely. The manual doesn’t have many information which is nice. I don’t like to read that. All the information is on the app. Just follow the setup on app step by step. It is very easy and quick to setup. The Bluetooth connection between the watch and the app is also quick. Charging is very fast as well. I would recommend this watch especially if you love training or outdoor.Read more by bufan chiu, I own Fenix 7, been using both for my exercise. To be honest there isn't a great a difference for me and the watch is $600 cheaper. Screen is better, battery lasts almost as long. Missing a couple of metrics, one that I use is respiration on the garmin, T-Rex 3 has the others. Yes it’s mostly plastic but it still seem well built(time will tell)I placed a screen projector on it so not all that worried about the screen. The shape of the watch is a bit different but that doesn’t bother me. For me, it seems more comfortable and is a bit thinner. All the information was pretty close to the garmin after my trek. The garmin Had to crank down the strap so the watch wouldn’t slip, the T-Rex 3 I didn’t. The screen is easy to view but so is the garmin in sunlight, in shade different ballgame. I’m not an athletic so the different between these two watches are really minimal for me. Changing the band is different. To put it bluntly the Garmin is going in the drawer.Would I recommend this watch, if you’re not trying to keep up with Mr Jones, yes The T-Rex is a better deal, at least for meRead more by E7Grunt, Looks and works greatRead more by Santiago.

Reviews: First off I am not a bot. This is a real review by just a regular normal guy. This is a really good watch for the money. It has all the features of a high end smartwatch but without the high cost. It looks nice while wearing it. I thought the face would be really big, but its actually a perfect size for my wrist. It lets you answer phone  calls  and read text. You cannot reply to text only read because you have no keyboard, but that's ok for me at least you can read them. You can change it up and customize it anyway you would like through the Zepp app. There are a lot of free apps and custom watch faces on the app that you can download for free. The health features are all great ,Heart rate , o2 stats and the exercise apps are all really good and keep track of multiple types of exercise like walking, running, and bike riding. All the health functions sync really well with my I-Phone.  The sleep app is really nice .You can keep track of your sleeping habits. It lets you see how long and how well you slept through out the night.  The charger charges the phone quickly and you can use it for 8-10 days depending on what apps you are running in the background.  You have to download the Zepp app to use the watch but its really not that hard and the app is very good. Its really easy to set up with the set up QR code. It comes packaged in a nice box with the charger and the user manual.  The charger  works very nice but the cord is a little short Its magnetic and it will only connect it the correct way every time. I have an apple phone and it syncs very easily to it with no issue and the Zepp app is in the apple App store. There is an Alexa link up on there so you can use your Alexa but I am not an Alexa guy so I don't really use it ,but who knows I might in the future at least its there.  All in all I say this is a great watch with a lot of very useful apps and functions. If you want a budget watch with all the high end function of an expensive watch this is for you. I really enjoy the functionality and the ease of use.  5 stars all the way. Signed-- Just A Normal Guy.Read more by Don B., This is a value packed watch!  It is waterproof.  It doesn't have a swimming app, but does a motor boating app, so you can track your boat trip...but that doesn't count as exercise.  Especially if I can cruise around the lake on my pontoon...drinking beer.  Oh...it does have a fishing app!  The GPS tracking is spot on...within a few feet.  The tracking is actually done on your watch...then sent to the phone.  I verified this by walking without my phone.  Not sure you could use it if you were hiking and got lost ...unless you have your phone with you to actually show the route.  The watch shows steps ( which is very accurate because I counted my steps over a .3 mile walk), distance, ave speed , duration, heart rate, and calories.  Battery life seems great.  I have used this for everything in notifications, and phone calls.  Had it for 4 days, and it's still at 64 percent.  I find that the sedentary reminders are a pain in the butt, so I shut them off.  I don't need to be reminded to stand up or walk when I am watching tv. The app is great...once you figure out how to navigate it.  There is sooo much on it, and it took me about 4 hrs working with it, and customizing it to suit my needs.  The watch faces are great.  There are a lot of free ones.  Even one that lets you use your own picture in the background.  The phone sound quality is really good.  I got this watch because my last one...when set to use the watch for phone calls...would send all of the phone audio to the watch.  I get that for music, but not for watching videos on my phone, so that had to go.  This one keeps the sound on my phone for videos.  You can set notifications on the watch to every app on your phone if you need to.  I have all of my cameras, messenger, and sms apps on it for now.  It is really nice that you can see what is going on with your phone in your pocket.  A must when I am driving.  You can type, and save, any quick reply text message you want, so you just select it on the watch, and it sends it.  Really safe...especially if your phone can't connect to your car.  This absolutely the best bang for your buck.  Just take your time to learn the app to set it up, and it will take care of you.  The instructions that come with it are pretty useless.  But then again...if you navigate the app or the watch yourself, you will learn more quickly than trying to read the small print on the paper anyway.Read more by pedalyurassoff, love that it does everything a gps watch does, without an outrageous price tag! i found the GPS to be accurate compared to Strava (pretty sure that uses the phone's GPS though lol). so i guess its pretty accurate compared to my phone's GPS. also like that it tells me how much and the quality of my sleep. though I wish it could detect when I go back to sleep after being awake for a while. also wish it was a darker pink than a baby pink, but thats a minor detail. battery also lasts around a week, maybe even more depending on GPS use. love it!Read more by Izzia Caperina, Es justo lo que esperabaRead more by Mar, La verdad es que tengo apenas una semana con este artículo y me parece que sí está cumpliendo con lo descrito a la hora de hacer la compra.

Brand: Fossil Copeland Men's Watch with Slim Case and Genuine Leather Band, Model: Fossil Copeland Men's Watch with Slim Case and Genuine Leather Band, Price: 56, Material: Stainless Steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Bought on sale approaching Christmas 2022 at 50% off for $48.SIZE: The watch case is 42mm which might not fit SM/MED wrists. See my photos for fitment on a XL hand with normal wrists.STYLE: I bought the 'Brown' model which has a very nice dark coffee brown band with a goldish-tan face, black digits and luminescent hands. I liked what I saw in the sales post, but think this watch would make a wonderful gift for any occasion. The contour of the face is eye-catching without being too much. I tested the luminescence and found I could identify time well enough. Case height is average. I do plan on adding a glass face protector to go on top to protect the original glass. This watch is 5 ATM so can withstand water pressure up to a depth of 50 meters before it suffers water damage. Personally, I wouldn't purposefully swim with a 5 ATM with a leather band, but it's comforting to know this watch is okay swimming for short periods of time or even worn in the shower and rain.PACKAGING: Amazon shipped this in a bubble envelope which adequately protected the standard, and squarish, FOSSIL tin container with teal and orange accents; the same tin shown in the sales ad photos. If your watch came in anything different then Once opened, the watch itself was in a protective plastic sheath, and the watch face has a plastic layer on both the front and back.Overall, I'm very happy with the watch both in the stout packaging, and its quality and appearance. I generally wear higher end watches but the appearance and minimalist design of this one caught my eye. It's the perfect watch for casual to casual-dress attire, and was an easy add to my collection at a very affordable sale price.Read more by JT, Everything, appearance, accuracy of the watch movements and price. well, worth the money.Read more by Jon neal, This watch looks very nice on my husband. Easy to read and lightweightRead more by Debby, I  use this watch mainly for a night on the town. No doubt a watch snob would pooh-pooh it, but I find it enjoyable to ear.Read more by Amazon Customer, The watch itself looks great! It's much lighter than I anticipated but it's still very well made and everything functions properly.The giftbox I received was pretty banged up. Lots of scratches/dents and overall just cheap junk. But easily replaceable by buying a different watch case, which I will be doing.Included inside the giftbox is a registration card. Typically, I wouldn't take the time to do so, but I was slightly skeptical of the watch being genuine and wanted verification of authenticity. The registration process was super simple and took about 2 minutes and the actually checked out to be a REAL Fossil watch.Even with the rinky-dink box, I would totally recommend buying this watch and I'm looking forward to my fiancé s reaction on Christmas!Read more by itmeMagic.

Highly recommended!Read more by MS3, One of my favorite watches! I like the simple design and it is fairly cheap. I have smaller wrists and 38MM fits perfectly. Haven't noticed any time drift on it. The only thing I could see being a negative is that it is fairly loud.Read more by Lance, I've had this watch for more than 5 years now and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I got it as a weekend/outdoors counterpart to my Timex Easy Readers that I wore to the office for more than a decade (one for brown belts, one for black belts). During Covid and WFH, it's even more literally my daily wearer. My Weekender has for years stood up to everything I've thrown at it, worked perfectly, and gotten me several compliments. It's easy to read and has a subtle elegance. At 38mm--not too big, but not small either--the size is perfect to serve you in the outdoors and also augment a subtle style or aesthetic on a night out.I don't like to swim, much less dive. So all I look for in a watch, in terms of WR, is whether it can survive me getting caught in a summer shower, get dishwater splashed on it, or, worst case scenario, a quick splash in the pool or ocean. I haven't swam in this watch, but I've certainly done the first 2 on those list with it. The case held up just fine, no fogging or worse, and wearing a fabric strap means it won't get funky--and you can just throw it in the wash anyway.Despite not swimming in it, I do "sport" in this watch otherwise--jogging, mountain biking, softball, etc. In all those situations, the watch was fine. No signs of slowing down, no cracks or scratches. The indiglo backlight flickers, but I have hardly used that since I was a teenager anyway. The quartz movement means you'll never have to set the watch like a manual needs daily, and like an automatic or solar may require. I've never replaced the battery on my Weekender or had to reset the time because it was off.After a day of sporting, you can toss the sweaty strap in the laundry and pick out a new one based on your outfit, all in a couple seconds. My Weekender was my introduction to NATO and other single-pass fabric straps, and they're now my go-to daily watch set-up.I've never replaced the battery and haven't noticed any lost or gained time. I should mention that I don't really adhere to the mentality that you need to measure how accurate a watch is over a year or more to judge its merits. This watch doesn't have a date window, which would mean several more resets per year, but between traveling between time zones and DST, I have to reset the Weekender several times a year anyway.I wouldn't wear this watch with a dressy outfit, but for everything up to that point, it looks appropriate. I don't like flashy watches or to walk into a room and have my timepiece be the first thing people notice, so this is perfect for me. You should never pick out a watch based on what you think watch snobs will think/say, but if you're worried about it looking 'cheap,' I've only gotten compliments about the Weekender. Like many affordable product lines, there is a surprising fandom out there for this watch. At this price point, I don't think anyone would regret buying it, and its versatility means it may become that go-to watch for when none of the rest make sense. And if it's your only watch--good choice.Read more by Count Mondego, This is a handsome watch. The numbers are large and visible, the ticking is not too loud, there is a backlight button, and it goes with everything. The only downside is the strap, which feels a bit flimsy and cheap. I’ve actually already got a small tear on it despite doing nothing strenuous in it.Read more by Dawson Cumberland, I needed a watch for everyday use in the country, where I might do anything from housework to running errands in town to barn work or dog training in 100 degree heat. It needs to be highly visible night or day without having to put on my glasses, keep good time, be low profile enough not to catch on things or get scratched up, and it's great if it looks good too. This watch does all that very well. The soft wide nylon band is more comfortable than my metal bands or leather ones, especially if I'm doing hot sweaty work.I got the greenish nylon band, and is is not nearly as green as the photo shows. It is definitely olive drab, an army greenish tan. Goes with everything. Looks very tactical, if you're into that.To sum up, I'm ordering a second one, and my husband wants one too!Read more by Rebecca Neef.
Brand: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 43mm Watch – Black Dial & Case with Brown Leather Strap, Model: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 43mm Watch – Black Dial & Case with Brown Leather Strap, Price: 35, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I'll admit I'm a watch fanatic and have WAY more watches than I should.  I'm very protective of most of them, but my collection includes a couple of "beaters" - watches that I don't mind putting in harm's way out in the yard or in the garage.  That category already had a 40mm version of the Timex Expedition quartz, which filled the bill nicely, but the deal on this newer model was such that I couldn't pass it up.  And, as the title suggests, it's actually quite good.  At 43mm it's a little larger than I prefer on my 7.5" wrist, but again it's a beater not a fashion statement.  It wears comfortably, comes with a decent leather strap, and has excellent legibility.  Although comfortable, I don't expect the strap to stand up to much abuse.  But, with 20mm lugs, it won't be hard to replace.  The case has good heft to it and is finished in a flat black.  It has a very "ruggedly casual" vibe to it.The caseback is the press-on type.  Water resistance is claimed at 50m, which means you'll probably be okay walking in the rain or washing your hands while wearing it, but that's about it.  If you change your own batteries it will take a CR2016 when the time comes.  Accuracy is very good, but no points for that as it's to be expected with a quartz.  I was pleased to see the sweep of the second hand matches up with the indices (most of the time), a small thing which can be problematic with some cheaper watches. The red tip on the second hand is a nice touch.  Although it looks like there is lume that has aged to a nice patina, there actually isn't any lume on the hands or dial.  That's okay, this is an Indiglo so a push of the crown lights up the backlighting.  It does require pushing the crown with your free hand, and the light only stays on as long as the crown is depressed.  It would have been a nice feature if the light stayed on for a few seconds after actuation, though.All in all, I'm impressed with this watch.  So much so that I'm pretty sure I'll feel badly the first time I bang the heck out of it in the garage.  Somehow I don't think the watch will care.Read more by D. Baker, Looks good on my wrist.  Not too big, not too small.  The leather band appears to be of good quality and easily replaceable with a 20mm watch band.  I bought this because it does not talk to me, notify me, or alert me to anything.  Only the date appears on the face.  Timex was king for inexpensive, reliable watches when I was a kid.  I know times have changed but I would buy again!Read more by billwunder, I love the Timex Expedition Watch and have loved it since I first received one as a Christmas gift from my In-Laws in 2002 after I became a fire chaplain. They reasoned I would appreciate the IndiGlow feature during fire calls in the dead of night. It was fantastic! Unfortunately, my Timex was damaged beyond repair in 2015. I’ve hinted that I wanted another to relatives ever since. My new Timex Expedition came just recently as I suggested the watch as a better gift than one my spouse had proposed. She came out spending less and I’m thrilled! It looks good, works perfectly, and becomes a new resource for my chaplaincy once again.Read more by Darrell M Coons, Item arrived new and unworn.  As usual  the packaging took a beating during shipping, but watch was fine, so far.  Dial is visible even in low light, because of the black/cream contrast.  You really only need the Indigo light if it's almost pitch black.  The leather band seems to be very nice quality.  I'll be applying a little watered down left over coffee to tone the white stitching to more of a cream/tan to better match the dial.  The hands are not luminous, despite what the item description says.  It's keeping good time so far, and fits my wrist nicely in an unobtrusive way.  Only negatives so far are the erroneous item description, and I wish both of the leather strap retaining loops were moveable.  the one nearest the clasp is sewn in, making it kind of tight to get the strap in their for my big fingers.Read more by DKMcGinnis, Keeps great time and good value. Awesome for those situations where you don't want to wear or risk a more expensive watch. I wear it traveling overseas and for outdoor activities. Durable, dependable and great value.Read more by Coyote Griller.
Brand: Citizen Promaster Dive Eco-Drive Watch, 3-Hand Date, ISO Certified, Luminous Hands and Markers, Rotating Bezel, Blue/Stainless (Model: BN0151-09L), Model: Citizen Promaster Dive Eco-Drive Watch, 3-Hand Date, ISO Certified, Luminous Hands and Markers, Rotating Bezel, Blue/Stainless (Model: BN0151-09L), Price: 199, Material: Stainless-steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: It has been a tradition for the last few cruises that I buy a watch onboard.  This time I would have, and this was the watch I planned to buy, but they didn't have it in blue, so I abstained on the ship, and ordered this one the day I got home.So why this one?  A couple of reasons.1.) It just has that classic diver look to it.2.) A friend of mine has this watch, and EVERY time I see it when we hang out, it catches my eye.  He abuses his, and years later it still looks great, which is a testament to its durability.3.) Feature packed.Ok - so let's talk about the features.1.) Eco Drive - this is a time-tested technology, and I have several Citizen Eco Drive watches, to include a 1st Gen Eco Drive purchased in 1996 that STILL takes a charge and runs when I get it out.2.) Mineral glass window - not the scratch resistance of sapphire, but TOUGH.3.) Accurate movement.  Prior to DST, I set the watch about 3 weeks prior and it had gained a grand total of 2 seconds.  That's about +3 seconds a month.  You can't find an automatic that will do that.4.) Water resistance to 200 meters with a screw-down crown.5.) Hacking movement - when you pull the stem to the 2nd click, the second hand stops, and that allows you to sync it to the exact second to another time source.-- Side note on movement.  I considered getting the version of this watch with the automatic/self-winding movement, but the movement in that watch is the Miyota 8204, which is a 21.6k movement (rather than 28.8k) that only has an accuracy guarantee of +/- 20 seconds/day.  I have other automatics that are considerably more accurate than thatBottom line - this watch looks great, and it's built to last.  I know I'll get a lot of years of use out of this timepiece.I've included two pics of this watch.  One with the stock blue rubber diver's strap, and another with an aftermarket bracelet that is specifically fitted for this watch case.  I'd name it here but I think that would invalidate the review.  In any case, it's pretty easy to find if you prefer that aesthetic, and it isn't terribly expensive - the stainless bracelet is well worth the investment and it gives the option of either aesthetic.Read more by Patrick Gleason, Overall, one of the best pieces of work gear I have ever invested in, for my line of work.I am a swimming pool technician, a pool guy, and have been for the last 10 years of my life. I work for one of the largest pool maintenance companies in SoCal and am now a Route Manager, overseeing over 800 individual pools.My everyday has and still consists of many different jobs.Cleaning swimming pools, where I am CONSTANTLY submerging my hands in chlorinated and salinated (salt) water, which does have a corrosive and/or oxidative effect on certain metals.Interacting hands-on with different corrosive and oxidizing chemicals, all of which gets on my hands and wrists at some point everyday.Maintaining, cleaning, and repairing various pumps, filters, plumbing, heaters, automation/electrical pool systems, and valves. This frequently places my hands in uncomfortable, tight spaces where I will bang, scrape, and smash my watches against concrete, metal, and other hard materials in the equipment areas I am working in.I have worn this watch every weekday for the last 5 years for this job. I replaced the original rubberized strap for a nylon/cotton blend NATO strap so it would dry quickly and breathe better. The watch face paint has stood up very well considering how rough my job is on it, with what would be considered as understandable wear and tear. And in my opinion, it gives a worked-in quality of character to the watch.The crystal itself has a few MINOR scratches, which I’m surprised hasn’t cracked or been marred even further, given that I have truly had it banged around hard in my line of work. None of these scratches affect the readability of the watch face at all. You actually have to look in an angled reflection to notice them.The lume of the glowing hands and digits are still VERY strong and last a pretty dang long time. I’m in the sun all day long and so the glow lume gets charged like crazy all day, then lasts for hours into the night.I can also say with certainty that I have NEVER had a battery issue, being that it’s an Eco-Drive and it gets a full belly of sun every working day, I’m not surprised at all. I don’t know when it will ever need a power cell replacement, but it's probably going to be a WHILE being that my line of work puts it in a recharging state at all times.Lastly, the steel body of the watch itself is as solid as when it arrived. It does have some scratch marks, but no gouges. And just in the last 6 months or so, a very light showing of rust-colored oxidization has been showing on the inside of the bezels. I’m surprised its taken THIS long to finally show some signs of oxidizing with how often its been scratched and banged, then plunged into salt and chlorine water and exposed to various chemicals.Overall, I am very pleased with the performance and durability of this watch. In a job where I quickly go through footwear, shorts/pants, sunglasses, hats, multitools/knives/handtools, and other pieces of gear, this watch has stood out as the most rugged and long lasting piece of gear I have bought for my job. I have no doubt it will last a further 5 years easily in the exact same conditions, especially if I give a light polishing for any oxidized areas (which I still haven’t yet).Highly recommend this watch for someone looking for a durable timepiece that can take a beating and still look classy and handsome. I also highly recommend switching to a NATO strap for an even more secure retention (watch won't fall off your wrist if one of the strap bars breaks or pops out).Read more by Eric, I previously had purchased the black version of this watch because I felt the black would go better overall with my normal casual wear.  But I liked that one so much that I decided to get this blue version also.  To my surprise, it actually goes better with my clothes than the black one does.  It can be worn for casual or dress.I love the location of the crown because it does not dig into my wrist.  The size is perfect and the colors are dark blue and not overwhelming.  I have to check twice sometimes to distinguish between the black and the blue.  The face is easy to read, but I  agree with some others who in their reviews were mildly critical of the date window.  It is recessed and small and is sometimes a struggle to read.  I have found that turning towards a light source usually solves the problem.  The illumination is fine as far as my needs are concerned.  The band is sporty and comfortable.  The bezel only turns in one direction, but is tight and precise. These two watches are my 4th and 5th Eco Drives.  They keep perfect time and you just have to wear them outside or put them on a window sill once in awhile.  Overall a fun watch with excellent quality and value.Like I said earlier, I liked the first one (black) enough to buy the second (blue) and I am happy with both.  They are fun to wear and add diversion to my modest watch collection.Read more by T. F.M., This watch is a great daily time piece.The Eco-Drive Solar Quartz movement is durable, accurate and does not require battery changes for an extended period of time with many users stating the watch has operated smoothly for more than 10 years. The case design feels extremely robust and is backed up by ISO Certified 200m water resistance. To further add to this, it also includes a screw down crown for more security. The lume is extremely good and the watch also features a date window. Lastly, I confidently chose this time piece as my daily due to Citizen's excellent warranty as well as the service center being only 45 mins from my home.When it comes to appearances, I personally enjoy the look of this time piece and have very little to complain about. This piece also comes in a multitude of colours and you will definitely find one that you would enjoy wearing on your wrist!Since this is a quartz watch, due note that there are times when the second's hands to not line up the the markings inside the dial. Mine did not have this issue but it is something to note! I did however run into this issue with my Citizen BM8180-03E which I also purchased on Amazon and this is where Citizen's warranty and service center location adds great value to this time piece.I dropped off my timepiece at their service center and filled out a short form for personal information. I received email confirmation of them accepting my time piece and after 4 weeks, I received my watch back with properly lined up seconds hand!Overall the only downsides I can think of is the strap. It definitely feels a bit stiff when you first get it but there are tricks you can find online such as using warm water and a cup to help form it to fit your wrist better!***Note***This Amazon sold model does not come with the strap that has the text for non decompression times and did not come in the traditional scuba bottle box.Read more by Tommy, Tengo muchos relojes automáticos pero andaba buscando uno de quarzo. Tenia un reloj Orient muy parecido a este similar al Mako 2. Compre este para ver si lo podía suplir. En calidad supero al Orient un 100%. Lo único que no me agrado es el bezel que es de 60 clicks y no se siente como los del seiko, pero te aseguro que no es malo solo no se siente como un Seiko. El dial es de excelente calidad mejor que los skx007/009 . Las manecillas excelente. El Lume súper brillante y en dos tonos. El brillo del dial es azul y el brillo del bezel es verde me gusto ese detalle de dos colores. Los acabados del case son excelentes. Otra cosa que no me agrado es que la tapa requiere una llave especial para cambiar la batería, aun que este reloj tiene una batería recargable así que no creo que sea problema en unos años resalto que esto por que rara vez dejo que le metan mano a mis relojes por lo general y mientras se pueda yo los reparo y les doy servicio. Calculo que la vida de la batería seria unos 6 años por experiencia. La fecha me gusto el lugar y el tamaño aun que para una persona que utilice lentes pueda ser algo chico. Por ultimo lo compre en oferta y es lo que mas me gusto.19/Jun/2018Se puede abrir la tapa trasera con llave de 2 pines aun que me decepciono ver la maquina tan pequeña que lleva dentro. Espero sea duradera. Hasta ahorita el reloj sin problemas. Queria un reloj de quarzo aunque soy mas de automático pero siempre se requieren algunos de quarzo.Read more by Amazon Customer.

Almost a bit too flashy - would have been better with a matte finish on the bezel, face and hour markers to tone it down a bit.  So far, though, I like it.  I use it for travel when I have to dress up a little for business meetings.  Didn’t want an expensive watch that I have to take off occasionally for security check points, or leave in hotel rooms while working out or doing outdoor activities, etc.  This one fits the need nicely.Read more by KodiakMan, I purchased this watch as a birthday gift for my uncle.

Brand: Bulova Men's Classic Aerojet 3-Hand Automatic Leather Strap Watch, Open Aperture, 40-Hour Power Reserve, Double Curved Mineral Crystal, 41mm, Model: Bulova Men's Classic Aerojet 3-Hand Automatic Leather Strap Watch, Open Aperture, 40-Hour Power Reserve, Double Curved Mineral Crystal, 41mm, Price: 197, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Been wearing this watch a few times a week for a little while now, and I really like it. It looks nice, feels nice, and keeps great time.  No complaints whatsoever. Good value for the money. Overall, I would recommend this.Read more by john schmerling, I appreciate how light this watch is because I can type at my computer without my wrist getting tired and hurting from the weight of it. This is a great work-appropriate office watch with understated timeless elegance and a beautiful leather watch band that will not go out of style. The leather watch band is soft on the underside and doesn't feel ruff when it rubs up against your skin. I know Bulova isn't considered a luxury watch brand, but the feel and look of it are serving understated luxury within a reasonable price, which I really like. The crown is easy to deploy and put back into place, and having an automatic watch is nice because there is no need to replace a battery.Read more by Shawn, Your Friendly Baker, I purchased mine on sale. Said the shipping was going to be pushed out till the next week. Came one day after the original delivery date. Great shipping, watch came in perfect condition. Like the title says I wear it everyday. Looks great in any style of clothing. I wear collared shirts and ties for work and basketball shorts and tee shirts on the weekend. Relatively light in weight. Feels good on the wrist. The watch is beautiful. The rose gold notches, hands, and crown resemble a subtle but classy look to the dark gray face plate. Winded it about 30-40 rotations when I opened it. I wear it everyday and it hasn't stopped on me yet. Fantastic watch for the money.Read more by Andrew Phillip Hartnett, Typical Bulova quality.

Brand: Timex Women's Easy Reader Watch, Model: Timex Women's Easy Reader Watch, Price: 34, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Stylish, simple, yet elegant. Readable numbers, good size (I prefer smart watches).Read more by Elizabeth R., The media could not be loaded.Okay so I used to have a Smartwatch with a silicone band. It was great for all the features,  but the silicone actually burned my skin, and I wanted something low tech. So I needed a watch with a natural material band. This is perfect!I love the size of the band; it's not too big or bulky for my little wrist. I love how dainty it looks, but the leather strap is actually so durable. I love the size of the watch face although if it was smaller face that would be totally fine too, just not bigger. This one is the 25 mm width one.The brown leather and gold is just the perfect classic elegant combo and goes well with casual or dressy clothes. I love the display that has the little date stamp on it. You just push the button in to see the glowy face at night.The button has 4 settings: OUT (change the time). MIDDLE (change the date clockwise) IN/NORMAL (the time and date tick normally), and Pressed IN (the glow light on the face turns on for as long as the button is pushed).Idk if anyone else does this, but sometimes I don't actually want a watch on my wrist,  and dont have pockets, but still want the time on me. So I put my watch on my ankle 😆😆 I actually did that on my wedding day,  and I have a photo of me lifting up my dress and checking the time on my ankle 😆. I'm telling you,  it's an amazing life hack.Anyways! This is the perfect watch.  I don't have any improvements to say. It's so amazing.Read more by Connie, Looking for a practical watch? This is it. I like the night light. Will see how long it lasts. Date window is tiny but can be seen. I didn’t buy the watch for the date window; have a smart phone. I have a small wrist and the band could be smaller. It’s the standard size. The band; well, it leaves a bit to be desired. It feels like plastic; stiff. Far from leather. For the price it works. 25 mm isn’t too big. I would prefer a smaller diameter clock size & still be round. Easy to set date.Read more by Jo Ann, I like the watch.  As expected, easy to read, with the much-appreciated Indigo light. 5* on the watch.  Black leather band is a little stiff but works just fine.However, I clearly got an old battery.  Watch was received in late May; battery died in early July, luckily NOT while I was.out of town.  Now I have to get a replacement battery (unexpected cost) & fight my way into the watch to replace the battery.  Inconvenient.Read more by Sarah, This is a fine watch with a clear dial and a nice leather strap. The numbers are easy to read even for someone whose eyesight is not very good.Read more by Aoushment.
Brand: Casio Men's Classic Japanese-Quartz Watch with Resin Strap, Black, 21 (Model: AE1200WH-1A), Model: Casio Men's Classic Japanese-Quartz Watch with Resin Strap, Black, 21 (Model: AE1200WH-1A), Price: 19, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Last updated: 7 Aug. 2019, 3 yrs. 9 months after original purchase.I purchased this watch Nov 2015, and the band broke June 2017. The band lasted just over 1.5 years. Note that I wore it 24/7 the *entire* 1.5 years! I literally only took it off to switch wrists probably 4 times over that period. It was on all day, all night, in the shower, in the pool, at the beach, in sports, etc etc you get the point.  I love this watch because it is super cheap (~$15) yet it has multiple alarms and a countdown timer instead of just a stopwatch timer. It's basically a G-shock quality watch for $15 instead of $45.When the band did break, it broke very suddenly! I didn't see any cracks on it or anything, but I literally rubbed my wrist across an object while turning and the band tore in two and the whole watch fell right off my wrist. Upon closer inspection, I saw cracks all along the inside of the band against my wrist, and if I bent the band hard it would break in other locations too.So, replaced the band with a nice durable nylon nato strap! I used this one (Replacement 18mm nato strap nylon watch band - Black, 5 ring Black PVD Buckle). It cost me < $10 and is an excellent watch strap! It (luckily) came with 2 pcs 18mm x 1.4mm spring bars instead of 18mm x 1.8mm diameter spring bars, which would have been too thick for this watch since there is so little space between the bars and the watch. This Casio watch comes originally with 2 pcs 18mm x 1.8mm diam spring bars, which are too thick when used with this nato strap.For the 18mm x 1.4mm bars, with a little work and a flathead screwdriver used to press the bar down hard against the strap (first to make an indentation in the band, with the bar not placed yet, and 2nd to press the bar into place), I was able to make this strap with the 1.4mm diam bars fit this watch!If you want to use a nato strap, expect it to be a very tight fit, and MAKE SURE TO GET A STRAP THAT IS 1.4~1.5mm thick max, and spring bars that are 18mm x 1.3~1.5mm MAX DIAMETER, *NOT* 1.8mm diameter. Otherwise it will be impossible to make it fit I think. I also used a spring bar tool (Ritche Professional 360pc Watch Band Stainless Steel Link Pins,spring Bars+remover Repair Tool (8-25mm)), which helped remove the old bars and situate the new bars, and I used a large flathead screwdriver with quite a bit of pressure to press the spring bar into place, indenting it against the watch, once the band was in place.Awesome watch! Awesome 18mm nato strap I've linked to above! Great combo together! I expect this combo to last me many more years than the original resin strap did.Update 7 Aug. 2019:I've had the watch now for 3.75 years. I've worn it 24/7 during this entire time: all day, all night, in the shower every day for nearly 4 years, while exercising, etc. I've only taken it off about a dozen times to switch wrists is all. I've had the 18mm nato strap on it for > 2 years (from June 2017 to today, Aug 2019).  Somewhere around 10 months to a year ago, one of the the spring bars broke out of the plastic hole on the watch due to excessive pressure since the nato strap was such a tight fit. So, I simply drilled 2 tiny holes in the watch and ran some 50 lb fishing line through and tied it off. Problem solved! That lasted about another year until the watch got water inside it just last week while swimming. I wonder if it was due to those holes I drilled somehow letting water in. I should have drilled sideways through the plastic tabs in the same holes where the spring bar used to connect instead of drilling down through the side of the plastic case like I did. Lesson learned: I'll do that next time.Anyway, time for another watch. Buying this same one would be a good buy.My only complaints about this watch are:1. It's bigger than preferred (I'd prefer a women's size watch honestly due to carpal tunnel wrist pain caused by doing pushups for decades and typing all day--the larger mens watches like this jam up into my wrist while doing pushups and exacerbate the situation)2. The time zone gets changed randomly sometimes while exercising or doing pushups, since a button accidentally gets pressed.3. The countdown timer has second-resolution (yaaay!, that's good!) but does *not* have the auto-repeat feature the G-Shock I had years ago had, which means I have to manually restart the watch after each countdown. I liked having the option to make it auto-restart the countdown when doing things like running laps or doing repetitive drills where I want to switch the activity every X seconds or minutes.That's all, folks. It's a good watch at a good price. 4 years 24/7 is highly respectable. And the nato strap? It's still in great shape. Good for another 6 years or so I bet (10 years total).Read more by Gabriel S, This is my favorite Casio watch I think. Even with my small collection of G-Shocks, and a few other Casio models, this is my favorite. This watch is my go to at home functional watch and my watch when I need to be really mindful of the time when I am out.Functions:Excellent backlight for Casio. Casio usually has ok backlights (Never quite as good as Timex), but the low end casio watches are usually lacking...not this one. It has a good backlight that lasts for a second or two when pressed that illuminates the entire time readout. This is a huge win for me as I use a light frequently to check a watch at night and in the early morning.Timer and Stopwatch: These are both on the watch and easy to use. They are effective at what they do and the alarms are load enough to hear them with mild ambient sound. Maybe not so much in a super loud environment, but normally I do not think this would be an issue.World Time: Also very easy to figure out and has an awesome map. I split my time between London and Los Angeles as we have our International office located in the UK and I like to readily know what time it is for my team out there. I also love the map, it makes it easy to tell when you are approaching the right timezone so you don't always blow passed it when searching for your own. Not to mention I just enjoy the aesthetics.Size and Style: This watch is very light for being pretty big. It is true to size and does not wear much bigger that it seems. I have small rests, but it feels comfortable and looks good. It does have some retro styling, this watch has not changed in a long time, and I feel that is a strong positive for it. It looks good. I have both this version and the round one, and this one is way better. The pushers on the round one are not metal. I took the band off and paired it with a Barton Brand green canvas 18mm band and it looks real nice.Some people mod these a little, or at least remove the wording on the case. I left mine alone, and will probably not attempt to mod it. The strap it comes with is comfortable enough, but cheap, so I would recommend another 18mm band. The Barton Brand 18mm quick fitting buckle band looked really good on this.So, for the price of the watch and maybe another 15 bucks, you can get an excellent all around watch that has functionality to perform tons of jobs around the house and even in travels for less than $50. I plan on using this whenever I am abroad for its ease of use, durability, and cost if it is broken or stolen. And yes the watch has good water resistance and has stood up through washing dishes, showers, getting knocked around during yard work, etc. Yes, it will pick up scratches, but the case and plastic crystal hold up pretty well for all of that.I highly recommend this watch.Read more by RyanT2, The Casio AE-1200 is an amazing watch at an incredibly affordable price. It boasts a stylish, retro design with a durable build that feels comfortable on the wrist. The world time function, multiple alarms, LED backlight, and impressive 10-year battery life offer exceptional value. Water resistance up to 50 meters adds to its versatility. Highly recommend this watch for its functionality and affordability. Excellent seller with fast shipping and great service!Read more by Anton, When Amazon asks if this watch is giftable, comfortable, or quality material it gets 3 stars across the board. However, when it comes to an overall rating I give this watch a resounding 5 stars. Why? Two words; functional, value.This watch does multiple timezones exceptionally well, allowing you to select 4 timezones to switch between with the push of a button, without relying on wifi/LTE which can be tough to come by consistently in international travel. The map is useful as well, darkening the countries/states that correspond with your current timezones setting, helping to ground you as to where you are on your travels. Being able to switch timezones so easily helps immensely with understanding timing for connecting flights, greatly reducing travel stress. All of this, for a price of $10-15, well worth it.Would I gift it? Maybe, if someone planned on traveling internationally. Is it comfortable? It's okay, light weight though the band isn't the most comfortable. Is it quality material? The band is a cheap composite band, the watch itself is fine, about what you would expect for the price. Should you get this if you plan to travel? Unequivocally yes.Read more by Sean, Relógio simples, leve, bem construído e extremamente funcional.

Brand: Casio Men's Quartz Day-Date Indicator Black Resin Dive Watch (Model: MRW200H-1BV), Model: Casio Men's Quartz Day-Date Indicator Black Resin Dive Watch (Model: MRW200H-1BV), Price: 21, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Great watch for the price. Usable bezel for timing events, 100m water resist, light weight, day/ date, decent lume with a charge from a light.....and it's very accurate. Need a watch under $20? Even under $50,  this is a good choice. Great travel watch. You don't need more.Update 2/19I have beaten on this watch like a red headed geek.....given it zero respect, with no regard to its well being....and it hasnt skipped a beat...its very accurate , loses a couple seconds a week maybe. For this price and to get this tactical cool look....its literally a zero brain proposition. It has a plastic crystal - making it uber light weight, but takes some scratches - so what?. I have pounded this thing doing chores, laundry, dishes, showers, grocery shopping, dog walking - all of the daily tactical things one does in the crazed world we live in. For the price, if you like understated simplicity and value for cash, this is it. When I do step out, and forget I have it on, I dont feel under watched, I still feel as if people will look at it and think it looks cool, masculine, even a little tactically sexy. The bezel is always being used to time things - from cooking, to whatever you need to keep track of.....you can use a dive type bezel is various ways - by minutes, or use it as an hourly reminder - say you want to remember when you last did something say, 1:30pm, just stick the red triangle at the mid point between 1 and 2, so you know it was 1:30 you did that item..etc, you get the idea....so for $15 bucks or so...you get that utility, in an accurate watch, that is durable, looks cool, has Day and Date, and some lume, just enough lume to work with....really, these watches are ideal for this money. You can really thump hard on this little red headed geek, but its always going to be your friend. Oh, and the other thing its great for - a tactical "sleeping" watch.....you dont want to have a bulky or heavy watch on at night....but you should have one - because you never know whats going to happen in the middle of the night - you dont even pay attention to this thing....its pretty much weightless....just charge the lume with a light or flashlight before bed, you will be able to see it well enough at 3am in pitch dark if needed. Forget a G Shock as a beater, why spend the money? $15 bucks, get a couple to just plop in your different vehicles or desk at work etc....reset them every 2 or 3 months and you are always good to go on the timepiece. Zero Brainer purchase. Hey, even if I was stepping into a field of battle - I would be ok with having this watch go with me as a primary timepiece.....take out your frustrations on the MRW-200h, it thrives on the abuse.Read more by chris, This watch is everything you need in a daily watch. Its legible, comfortable to wear, accurate, tough, what else could you want for such a low price ? Highly recommended.Read more by Sarah Makai, This watch was only 25 bucks. I really like the look of it. Simple and elegant. It does all the basics: hour, minute and second hand, date and day of the week, and it has a movable bezel like dive watches. And it's water resistant up to 10 bars, or 333 feet. That's pretty amazing for twenty-five bucks. I've paid ten times that amount for watches that do no more than this one. The black is very attractive. I replaced the chintzy-looking rubber strap with a good looking black leather strap.  I don't know how long this watch will last, but I've had Casios that lasted ten years. I had another one like that that a friend gave me but it quit working, and the 25 bucks for a new one is less than a horologist would charge to fix the old one.Read more by Guthrie McIllhennon, I was looking for an inexpensive, large-face analog watch that I could use for travel when I wanted to leave my more expensive watches safely at home.  This large face Casio was the perfect solution.  The watch face is indeed large - about the same size as my 45mm Apple iWatch9 (see photo). The large face is easy to read; the 24 hour numbering is convenient for overseas travel where time is often referenced on a 24 hour clock (for example: 2:00 pm = 14:00).  Priced at about $22 (as of 27 Aug 2024) this watch is also a great value.  RECOMMENDED.Read more by C. Green, Great casual and outdoors watch, nice look, very durable.Read more by James F..

It has many features and everything seems to work great. For me health-related features were most important - heart rate, oxygen meter, and sleep pattern; also exercise and a pedometer are all great features to have.It also has many other features - a stopwatch, timer, alarm, message notifications, and music player; you can make a call (haven't figured out if I can receive calls on it yet). It pairs with your phone and you can see and control some features from the phone app too.Battery life is great - probably going to last 4-5 days on full charge with regular use.Read more by Nick.
Brand: Anne Klein Women's Leather Strap Watch, Model: Anne Klein Women's Leather Strap Watch, Price: 24, Material: Metal, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: My mom has been on a hunt for a wrist watch but she is very picky about how they look and the style. It’s been nearly impossible to find what she likes. I have these a try and ordered them for Mother’s Day. She absolutely LOVED them! I got the brown leather ones and they look so nice on her wrist. They are the perfect size and she already received so many compliments. They are not heavy, comfortable to wear, and look a lot more expensive than what they were. She now wants a different one with a different strap.

I might purchase this style in other colors, I love it so much. I can’t speak on how long the band lasts or battery life as I just received it, however I will say my oldest Anne Klein watch is 4 years old and still ticking in good condition.Read more by Leena Yun, I love this watch, and I’ve gotten compliments on how it looks. I also love that, even though I don’t normally, I can wear it in water like a quick shower or swimming. The one downside is the two little “leather” straps that hold the buckle part down (not sure the right term for it—see picture) broke within a couple months of wearing it. So now the excess just kind of hangs off and gets caught in my hair or on things. But I still wear it. Because overall I still like the watch. It works well and I like that they had already set the time to my time zone so I didn’t have to set it when I got it 😅 so that was nice. Anyway, I wanted a feminine watch and I feel this one is attractively so.Read more by Heidi Smith, I love the style of this watch and the price was amazing! My mother loved it!

Reviews: My Galaxy (4) watch was ready for an upgrade!I always do my research and read the reviews before I buy a product. This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!Read more by marlene, The SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch is an exceptional device that combines durability, advanced technology, and AI-powered features for both everyday use and fitness tracking.

Though the size may be large for smaller wrists and the app ecosystem is more limited compared to WearOS, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is ideal for fitness enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers seeking a reliable, intelligent smartwatch.Read more by M., I'm liking it so far, I can respond to my WhatsApp messages from the watch if you like voice to text its good enough I haven't had problems with it, you can also type by hand writing or keyboard, I can also control my Spotify music and choose Playlist or artists the screen is very responsive I haven't had problems with it not detecting my fingertips even with gloves, my favorite feature so far is the health monitor that's always active showing me my heart rate during the day and tracking my sleep showing me how much I slept, how long and the different stages of my sleep, you can also download more apps and I downloaded 2044 for when I just need a small game to distract my brain, with all those features and more this watch battery doesn't last a whole day it may last about 16 hours more or less depending on how you use it if you don't want the health tracking if probably can last longer, the watchband I didnt like I bought an after market one and now It looks more casual.Read more by David, It does everything as advertised well. I went with this model rather than the plus because it was lighter and less bulky.Read more by JHC, I upgraded from 4 to 7 and I can see the difference!Battery life is a little worse but will last you a day. Also charges super fast. I put it to charge while I shower and that is more than enough.All the trackers on it are better and give me more data. And the green color is a nice change for the always boring smart watches.Read more by Jay.
Brand: Casio Men's Classic W800H-1AV Sport Watch with Black Resin Band, Model: Casio Men's Classic W800H-1AV Sport Watch with Black Resin Band, Price: 19, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Bought this 2 years and 8 months ago and it's still great. In that time, it's drifted 27 seconds (e.g. at 8:00:00 it now reads 8:00:27). **EDIT** This drift is inaccurate. Updated at bottom of review **END EDIT**. For me, that's not a big deal, but figured I'd mention it. I wear the watch face-side down on my wrist, but it only accrued one mild scratch in all that time. Nothing terrible. I bought this watch because it had 3 things; the 24-hour time, the day of the week, and the date on a single screen. It's the only watch I've found that had all 3 of those. To find all 3 in a highly rated and CHEAP watch? I bought it in a second and haven't regretted it since. I actually returned a better and more expensive watch (Casio DW5600E-1V) before eventually finding and loving this. I especially love that it orders the date in Year-Month-Day format. I live in the US where Month-Day-Year is the norm, but I also work with thousands of computer files where the best way to organize files by date is with a Year-Month-Day system (e.g. 221102 for November 2, 2022). It's just a little nothing thing, but I love this watch for it.I should note that the watch band snapped off back in August, 2 years and 5 months after getting the watch. That's happened with other watches with resin bands that I've owned, always around the 2-3 year mark. I heard it's from sweat or showers hardening the resin or something. That could make sense as I never take mine off except when I'm rock climbing. Regardless, I just grabbed a cheap 18mm silicone watch strap for 12.99 and it's been fine ever since (bought silicone because I heard they don't snap. I'll update this if it ever does).I plan to use this watch forever. If it breaks, I'll buy a new one for the price of a burger + onion rings. I've gone through a dozen watches over the past 25 years or so, but this is the first one that I loved. It has everything I want without a bunch of other useless expensive crap that I'll never use (looking at you, altimeter; and that's coming from a hiker). It's cheap, reliable (anecdotally), has a fast band replacement process, no feature-bloat, has large text, and is DECENTLY water resistant. The only downside is that the watch isn't 200m water resistant. If it was, it'd be perfect for me. Anyway, I don't go surfing/swimming with it, but it hasn't fogged up after 2+ years of showers, rain, sweat, etc. If you want a cheap watch, I recommend this one (unless you're an avid surfer). Or if you're like me and willing to fork over $100 for a watch, maybe buy this anyway. It's certainly much better than the $21 price-tag would have you believe.**EDIT** 12/12/23I made the above review over a year ago, but I realized that I couldn't verify that the 27 seconds of drift was accurate. Well, I decided to run a little experiment over the past year and record the drift every few months (basically whenever I remembered I was even doing this) and it turns out that the drift WASN'T accurate. After a year, my watch drifted 58 seconds. To get that 27 second value, I might have reset my watch whenever we had daylight saving time or something, hence the inaccurate drift. Anyway, I included the recorded values below (MM/DD/YY format) in case someone is interested. Also, I used time.gov for the baseline comparison.12/11/22  9:55PM - 0 seconds fast01/19/23  6:18PM - 5 seconds fast02/22/23  12:48PM - 10.5 seconds fast04/15/23  9:00PM - 18.5 seconds fast05/08/23  8:22PM - 22 seconds fast06/27/23  12:52PM - 30 seconds fast09/06/23  8:15PM - 41 seconds fast11/05/23  7:18PM - 51 seconds fast12/11/23  9:55PM - 58 seconds fastThis basically means my watch drifts by a little more than 1 second every week (1sec/~6.29days). For my needs, that's fine. I'm not doing anything in my daily life that requires long-term precision to the second, and I have to reset it every so often anyway for the aforementioned daylight saving time, so I don't mind at all. Other than that, the watch still works great (nearing 4 years now) and the "new" silicone watchband is still great too (although it hasn't hit that 2-3 year breakdown point yet). So, all in all, still happy with it.Read more by onwa, I have been using this for a few weeks. I've done a couple hikes that included cliff jumping, climbing, and water for multiple hours. I took it scuba diving for two days and we were in the ocean constantly. It held up perfectly. I dove for two days averaging 30-40 feet deep but 65 at the deepest. It did great for all of that. I used the stopwatch underwater multiple times. The display is crisp and clear. Buttons are perfect size. Easy to push even with scuba gloves but they don't dig into your wrist. The light works great. It doesn't stay on for more than a second unless you hold it but I like that. Less battery wasting. The strap is a little long. I have small wrists so I cut it shorter. I regretted that in a thick 7ml wetsuit when the long strap would have been nice, but it still worked. I've seen others exhange the straps. The alarm is enough to wake up with. It beeps 10 times and then stops. It will go again every 5 minutes if you have the snooze setting on. So far I have one tiny scratch on the surface. Only noticeable if you really look for it. That's pretty good for the abuse I've already put it through. My favorite part about it is that it replaces having to get my phone out or turned on for time, stopwatch, and alarm while I'm backpacking/hiking/diving. People think that you need to have expensive gear to have fun outside and that's usually not true.Read more by Amazon Customer, Easy to set, light weight, inexpensive, durable.Read more by Karl Winneker, UPDATED AT THE END***This Casio rocks.  I read up on watches for a few weeks (yes, I'm neurotic like that) before purchasing.  Even checking out $120 Seiko Automatic watches, et cetera.  I settled on this digital watch because it is a die-hard, long-lasting, easy-to-use, and easy-to-read watch.A few months later?  I am stoked!Let's address the elephant in the room first:  The lens scratches easily.  Yes and No.  It does get scratched when I bang it hard against drywall or concrete while I'm working.  But it is SUPER easy to fix.  I just put a dab of toothpaste on a cloth and rub it against the lens for a few seconds, then rinse it under water.  The scratch is gone.  I've done this twice now and the watch looks brand new.The display is bright at night.  The alarm wakes me up.  The watch itself has only gained 2 seconds over the course of 3 months (I check it against an atomic clock everyday at work.)I would recommend this watch to anybody that isn't too proud to rock a durable little digital wristwatch.  The display is amazing:  Show the name of the day, full date, time (including seconds), as well as whether the alarm, snooze, and signal modes are activated.  Comfortable band, doesn't get smelly like leather.I have HUGE wrists.  I'm 6' 3" and have large hands and this watch fits me great.  Could easily tighten up several notches for people with normal sized wrists.It's not that classy looking, but it is a tank.  I feel naked if I leave the house without it now.  Just like my pocketknife.***UPDATED***Band is crap.  Time piece is still great.  About 2 years after purchasing the band completely fell apart.  I kept it together with super glue and electrical tape for about the last 6 month's of the band's life.  It cracked and split A LOT.  The watch itself will last for years, but not on my wrist, unfortunately.  It is cheaper to buy another watch than to get a replacement band.  Is this what economists refer to as Planned Obsolescence?***Another update:  after 3 years the barn is toast again.  I will keep buying this watch.  I'm in love with this model.  I have no doubt the timepiece will last for the full ten years as advertised.  The bands are 3 years tops.  I still have my older watches from years past relegated to backpacks and glove boxes.Read more by Lester Burnham, Good quality, many uses, easy to use, lightweight, comfortableRead more by William.
Brand: Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watch, Model: Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watch, Price: 82, Material: Stainless-steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Frankly, I was somewhat skeptical. A decent, let alone good, watch at this price from ... ahem ... Invicta? Well, my experience 2 weeks or so into ownership has pretty much proven my suspicions to be ill-founded. This is a terrific watch, made all the better because of the "silly" price. Pay 20x the money or much more, if you want, in terms of a quality watch, you won't do better. OK, it doesn't say Omega or Rolex on the dial. But, let me take you through my likes and dislikes.1. Appearance.It looks terrific straight out of the case and appears to be well made. On my wrist, I think it looks great -- it's 40mm, ie, medium sized these days, and that suits me.2. Feel.It has a surprising heft. I wasn't expecting this for a watch at this price-point, but it feels substantial, but not overly heavy, when wearing it.  I like that very much -- it's reassuring, somehow, and suggests robustness and superior build quality to my way of thinking.3. Durability.Too soon to tell, overall, However, when I accidentally banged the watch against a heavy metal gate the other day, I winced, fully expecting to find at least a cracked or scratched crystal, or damage to the strap. Nope. Nada. I wasn't just relieved, I was, again, very pleasantly surprised by this piece.4. Reliability.Again, probably too early to say, overall. Again, however, I will say this: my watch has been keeping perfect time. Saying so here will now probably jinx it, but we shall see. I was not expecting this from my own prior experience with an automatic watch, and some of the other reviews here. It wouldn't have bothered me too much, as I viewed time gain/loss as part of the automatic watch experience -- and I like to engage with my devices. Sort of like preferring to drive stick over automatic. It's a personal thing. But, so far, this watch has kept perfect time.5. Automatic movement.I just prefer it to quartz, although quartz is, typically, just perfectly accurate. I didn't want to see the word "quartz" on the dial, and I liked seeing the watch-movement on the back of the case. That movement, however, is painted yellow, not left stainless. Initially, I was put off by this because I just didn't like the aesthetic. However, I almost never see it as the watch is on my wrist all the time, and now I've become used to it anyway.6. Service.This also really surprised me. I took delivery of the watch and followed the instructions (or so I thought) to set both the time and the date. Problem: time re-set ok, but not the date, no matter how often I tried. I was disappointed and annoyed with myself. After all, at this price-point, what could I expect? So, I waited 24 hours and was advised I could either get a complete refund or a replacement. If io ted for the replacement, i would have 30 days to return the original, or else my card would be charged again. I opted for the replacement, which arrived a few days later. Again, I was unable to set the date, although the setting the time went flawlessly. Again I was frustrated, but also skeptical of the possibility that not one but two watches had the identical issue. Perhaps the problem wasn't with the watch, but with me -- perhaps I was doing something wrong? I took them to a nearby jeweler/Invicta dealer, who showed me that, yes indeed, the problem was me. When setting the date, even though you are going forward, you have to wind backwards, ie, counter-clockwise. Problem solved! I therefore returned the replacement watch and kept the original. Yes, the instructions in the box could have been clearer, but I was mightily impressed by the Seller (Amazon?) immediately sending me a replacement with no questions asked, and then giving me 30 days to return the original before charging my card.7. The"unboxing" experience.People post YouTube videos of themselves unboxing their latest doo-dad all the time. Certainly, there is something satisfying about unboxing your new iProduct or Cartier that adds to the whole ownership experience. This, for me, was not that. The box is a horrible vinyl. The yellow color isn't exactly subtle, but would probably look better in cardboard. I don't keep it out anywhere visible. The instructions are stuffed into the lid and don't fit. It all looks and feels wrong. The watch itself was covered in a number of transparent protective tapes, that were tricky to remove and required some patience. All that said, none of these (minor) gripes have affected my overall, very positive experience.8. Value For Money.You could get yourself the quartz version for about $30 cheaper at the time of writing. While that's not nothing, and is about a full one-third less than this watch, I opted for this model. The quartz model also has a slightly different bezel, one which I actually prefer as it's a little more modern and subtle, without the classic, jagged "teeth." This watch has the traditional look. However, for me, an automatic stainless-steel diver's watch with these looks, heft and reliability at this price, represents excellent VFM.9.Conclusion.If you're considering this watch, I say buy it. It's very reasonably priced for what it is and you'll have ample time to return it if you don't like it.Read more by Mr. Manalyst, This has been my first automatic type watch purchase. I refused to dive head first into purchasing, what could be considered a "higher end" brand as my first automatic. Examples include citizens (eco-drive), Seiko, Movado (I have one non-automatic), Bulova (I have two non-automatic) and so on. I'm pinching pennies as it is with the economy as it is. What does someone do when they want a watch for a price that won't break the bank, looks nice, functions well, and you can see yourself wearing it frequently?I rarely wear my Movado or Bulova's - matter of fact, I put those in a safe years ago. I only wore them with business suites etc. As daily wear watches, I've bought throw aways over the years. Casio digital watch, timex, no brand names and hell, even a smart watch (which I rarely used to it's full purpose)Enter the Invicta Pro Diver**Pros**- Watch Feels Solid - The band feels like good construction and so does the watch- Band is not loud - I can't really describe what I mean by this but some watch band links "cling" togetherwhen you move or the watch moves. Like it's cheap and loose. Not this band. It's solid.- Looks great - The colors on the band, dial, and so on really pop- Keeping good time - It arrived active already - I set the time last night, right to the second, and so far it's right on the money (I used my desktops windows time to nail the seconds down)- Higher end movement - I did a lot of research on the Seiko movement (NH35A) and according to some online sources, this is a 40.00 dollar movement by itself.- Water Resistance - I was looking forward to having a watch I could wear at all times. Even in the shower. Something as trivial as needing to take a watch off to shower and put back on after is annoying. I showered with it and (**important** make sure the crown is screwed down and tight to turn clockwise) I have no issues to report**Cons**- Clasp Quality - The clasp feels solid for the most part. I could foresee it wearing down over time. Kind of why I've decided to rarely, if ever, take off the watch. I'm not too worried about this.- Does not glow in the dark very well - I don't really know much about the science behind luminous but I can tell you that I'm simply not able to tell the time in the dark. It does glow but not bright enough in my opinion.- Invicta Branding - Some may have no issue with having an "Invicta" engraving on the bezel and the Invicta symbol on the second hand. Some may find that tacky. I personally don't really care.**Take Away**I'm happy with my purchase. I paid 74 bucks (I'm including taxes etc. in that price) for an automatic watch that functions well, looks great, is solid built, and will accomplish what I had as an end goal for buying my first automatic watch. Time will tell (pun intended) how well this watch holds up. I'm not a very daily active person. Meaning I work in an office setting. Not much going on that could cause any sort of issue for the watch. I am active during the week and on the weekends going to the gym etc. I plan on wearing the watch throughout all of those activities. I'll definitely be putting the watch through its paces.If you're just getting into the automatic side of watches, in a market saturated by countless brands mimicking other brands, and where a decent name "high end brand" starts at 150.00 (for really bottom barrel automatics) , to better looking name brand watches priced 300.00 to 500.00 , and you're wanting to save a buck, I think you'll be happy buying this watch.It checked most if not all my checkboxes. For the price and movement quality, you simply can't beat it.Read more by Laxluver1234, This is a solid well made time piece.Looks great, and feels good on my wrist.Really accurate keeping time, no issues.Well worth the price!!!Read more by Karl, Invicta gets a lot of hate from the watch community, but if you’re looking to get into automatic movements at a super affordable price this is the watch for you!Overall the watch is pretty solid at this price point, but there is some quality control issues to be aware of. Upon delivery the bezel of my watch was loose and would rotate a full click clockwise even though it’s supposed to be unidirectional, so that’s an issue I’ll need to fix.The screw down crown works well and easily adjusts the time and date window.The bracelet is relatively solid, but doesn’t feel like the highest quality, which will be an aspect of this watch you may look to replace.The movement is the ever reliable NH35A from Seiko and there are no complaints to be had regarding the movement. It’s a work horse and will absolutely get the job done for years to come.It’s a nice looking watch and is comparable in style to the Rolex Submariner. It will look good on wrist, and if taken care of can last quite some time!It was delivered in a hard shell plastic case and came with 2 silica packets to keep any moisture from becoming an issue in transit. Plastic wrapped to avoid any scratches as well.Read more by Joehl Crawford-Robinson, Muy buena compra funciona súper bien y se ve muy bien también reloj versatilRead more by Héctor perez.
Brand: Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Garrison Field Watch in Stainless Steel with Olive Nylon strap, Black Dial (Model: BM8180-03E), Model: Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Garrison Field Watch in Stainless Steel with Olive Nylon strap, Black Dial (Model: BM8180-03E), Price: 187, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: A year or two ago I bought a watch from Amazon when it was on sale for 1/2  price. It was a dandy watch, worked perfect, but it was *huge*, and pretty  heavy. It was also pretty flashy, and I'm  not. So I wound up only wearing it for "dressy" times, e.g., like church.  Finally, the battery died, and I decided I didn't like the watch well enough to go to the expense of buying a new battery and the hassle of putting it in.So I decided I would buy a new watch that (1) wasn't as big, heavy, and flashy as this one, and (2) didn't have a battery - I hate messing with batteries. So  I started researching watches, and when the next Amazon watch sale came along, I found a lovely *automatic*  (we called it "self-winding" in the "old days") Seiko in the "military-inspired" minimalist style was that I was looking for. I *almost* bought it, but the rating was a flat 4.0/5, and there were enough negative reviews about stopping working and other problems that it gave me pause. In addition, I doubted that a self-winding watch would work reliably for someone like me who doesn't wear a watch all the time.So I did some more research, and discovered that there was a 3rd class of watches - solar-powered!! And the "solar" supposedly means any kind of light. I found this Citizen watch that looked almost exactly like the Seiko that I liked and almost bought. It was about 85 bucks, which seemed reasonable, esp. for a watch that didn't require me to buy a battery or even to walk around...lolI've had this watch for about 32 days now. I love the look, and it is keeping perfect time. I still only wear it when I go out (i.e., not around the house),  and I've been leaving it in the kitchen where there is usually natural light during the day, plus bright artificial light on and off. So far it has worked fine. I did have to charge it under bright light for something like 12-15 hours initially, so I just left the kitchen light on overnight. I suppose some would say that cost me maybe a  quarter, but I can live with that.The strap is of decent  quality, albeit a bit stiff (I'm sure that would have loosened up with wear),  but I just didn't like having to futz with securing the strap ever time I put it on (yes, I'm old and set in my ways). This was solved by one of the major life lessons I got from my dad. Along with teaching me how to determine the model year for 50s and 60s Fords and Chevys (back when they *didn't* all look alike, and when unveiling the new model Chevy was an actual event in my small town), and warning me to "never buy a used car, you're just buying somebody else's problems", my dad introduced me to the Spiedel Twist-O-Flex watch band. When he bought me my first watch when  I was around 12, the first thing we did was take off the band that came with it and replace it with a brand-new Twist-O-Flex (yes, we had to take out several links to get it to fit my thin young wrist). Heck, I didn't even know you could take the band off a watch, much less change its size !!! This watch has an 18mm aperture (or w/e you call it where the band attaches), and an 18mm Twist-O-Flex fits it perfectly.The only negative would be the dearth of documentation. Other than a little folder with a few lines in about 30 languages, I was referred to a web site for info on charging and setting, etc. This is standard in the 21st century, but it still chaps me a bit.I won't apologize for the length of this review. This is the kind of review I like to find when I am considering buying an item, so this is just "do unto others" for me.Keep it up, Jeff B., you are doing a great job !!!P.S. I added a couple of pics with the new band, mainly to practice with my new Kindle Fire...:)Read more by JaggedOne, After looking at almost 100 watches on Amazon, and closely at 6, I chose the Citizen Eco-Drive BM8180 because it met, and exceeded, the adjectives I applied to it in this review's title. I closely considered the similar Eco-Drive field chronograph, 2 Seikos (both 'field' styled, and both automatics), a Bulova, a Stuhrling, and an Invicta. It is the Citizen BM8180 for me (I have had the BM8180 for almost two months now), for these reasons, and in despite the one caveat:*Traditional materials & old-fashioned proven design. A solid steel case and back, and glass/mineral crystal, along with the 'plain' black dial and simple numerals. Details like the crown guards and a claw-screw back emphasize a handsome, well-made timepiece. Also carries a 5-year parts & labor warranty (and a 20-year warranty on the 'power cell').*Eco-Drive: no batteries, no 'winding' dependent on how active I am (and automatics all deviate at least 1 minute plus per month below the $400 and up range). Solar-powered quartz movement, so just "set it & forget it." I am a bit nocturnal, so to be on the safe side I set the watch on the windowsill for an hour of mostly direct sun once a week, which should keep it fully topped off at all times. Any source of artificial light is also fine (incandescent, fluorescent, halogen, even a REALLY large candelabra will do it!).*Feels great and very substantial in my hand, on my wrist, and when setting.*A very good, known maker, and at a price so low I want to tell people I paid MORE (I paid $81US, March 2010)!*And more than a little: a remarkably high & consistent rating on Amazon. It is indeed very rare to see any item on Amazon receive such high marks and comments, with so few negatives, over such a long period of time. I have been an Amazon customer since 1998 and bought watches, cameras, computer equipment, pens, books, CDs, DVDs, audio equipment, flashlights, small hand tools, luggage, and who knows what else, and I can't remember another item that so nearly universally gave it's purchasers here such a strong positive experience.*Setting the watch is easy, straightforward, and mostly intuitive, except for the warning not to set day/date between 9pm and 4am, which has to do with mechanical workings internally, and is not any inconvenience. A few people have not read either the Amazon product page or any of Citizen documentation, and have damaged their timepieces. So just don't be an impatient dope.*The only caveat or negative I'd offer I don't find an issue, myself. The band is tightly-woven OD green canvas with a sewn black leather backing (another mark of quality old-school manufacture). The solid steel grommets are large. It is stiff at first. After 2 weeks it loosened and lengthened about 3mm. I have pretty thick wrists and I am on hole 2, even 3 on some days. It is a good looking, substantial band. I like it.*All the other things: it keeps good time, losing just slightly more than 1 second in 9 weeks, which makes it 5-6 seconds deviant a YEAR. There is no backlight, but the hands glow legibly for 30 minutes or more after lights out. It is perfectly silent, even pressed tightly to my ear. The day function reads out alternatively in spanish, if you like or need it to. The requirements for light recharge are modest and will be easy to meet or exceeded by nearly everyone who wears this watch. 100 meter water resistance, which will be retained, unlike watches that must be opened every 2-3 years to replace the battery, thus ruining their real water resistance unless repacked by a pro for $$. The Citizen docs are clear, easy to read, and extensive.All in all, I give this watch an unreserved strong recommendation, a 5-star item for certain. I was prepared to hate the band and replace it right away, and the BM8180 would still have been a 4+ star. So for a handsome, solid, dependable, and inexpensive watch, you can't go wrong here.Read more by W. White, Muito bom produto, recomendo.Read more by Antonio Vieira, I would have liked it to be a bit bigger, but I took it with me on a hunting trip and found it to be the perfect watch. Many hunters prefer digital watches, but these often emit beeps from time to time. With this watch, the time is clear, and as a bonus, you can use it as a compass if you take the time to learn how (as with any analog watch). I love the color of the wristband, which is why it is my go-to watch for field trips. Citizen is a very good brand, even though it is underrated by some. I have some of their classic watches, which are good starters for a collection, but this one is truly my favorite (Citizen). Unless you're in a war zone and need a Rolex that you can trade with the locals in an emergency (as special operation troops apparently do), this is a great watch for the average guy, especially when you're outdoors, particularly hunting. It is quite efficient and looks dapper.Read more by Alexandre Martel, Just love the simpleness in the design yet gives the watch a handsome look.It's one year and running great.

Brand: Armitron Sport Women's Digital Chronograph Resin Strap Watch, 45/7012, Model: Armitron Sport Women's Digital Chronograph Resin Strap Watch, 45/7012, Price: 12, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I really like the large display that’s very easy to read outside. The band stays locked extremely well. The band has a sleek design. The light button is on the right side but otherwise I love it. I’m super impressed with the fit and quality. I tried the discounted returned item and it was perfect. The box was a little banged up and the instructions were missing but for $6 less than regular price I think it was worth it. I’m so glad I found another water resistant watch. Buy it, you’ll love it.Read more by Jimmer- J, I loooooooove this little gadget so much. The day after I bought the watch, they put it on SALE!!! I almost bought another one because, for $13 (sale price), you get a sturdy, stylish watch that is easy to use and reprogram.The watch is also water-resistant. I wash a lot of dishes lol so it's really nice not to have to fiddle with my watch every time I have to put my hands under water! It's been about 3 weeks since I bought the watch, and it's really helped me at work with managing my time, and I love how many modes this little watch has. It has a spot for a second time zone, an alarm that beeps at you a few times when it goes off, and a stop watch, and if you press the ST/STP (start/stop) button, you'll be able to see the month, day, and year. Super great purchase!Read more by Ale Alvarez, I purchased this watch in the middle of a summer camp season in 2022 after my 15-year-old Timex sports watch (Yes, 15 years old—so old that the model is no longer made) finally gave up the ghost. With its predecessor having survived everything from water to mud to bicycle crashes, I had high expectations for this one.So far everything is going well. The watch does have a 24 hour mode, which is essential for me, as well as an alarm, water resistance, and an attractive gold-coloured face plate. It has survived everything I have thrown at it so far, from waterskiing to 100-degree heat, to washing dishes in a commercial kitchen. Armitron got all the most important stuff right even in a shrinking market; the reason I did not give this a 5 star review was that this watch does have a few odd quirks that I have detailed belowPros:Excellent priceReasonably stylishSmall, compact and light weightWater resistant (this does not mean fully waterproof; do NOT press the buttons underwater)24 hour time and a serviceable backlightShows no signs of wear even after 4 months heavy use.Cons:Display lacks some contrast compared to my old TimexWhile it allows you to set the year in its date readout, it does not do daylight savings time automatically—somewhat puzzling because I thought that was the point of setting the year.Cannot figure out how to swap the T2 auxiliary time zone into my primary time zoneNo count-down timerWhile the faceplate is gold, the band clip is silver. This is unimportant if you buy a silver one.The lettering on the front that reads “Armitron WR 330M” faded away within 4 days.Not quite as accurate as my old Timex—I lose about 1 minute per month, which is just okUpdate, April 2, 2023: About 8 months later, and still going strong. The plastic watch face is proving to be more scratch resistant than my previous Timex, and I still feel that the watch is presentable outside of work.Read more by E. Jo, I bought a few sports watches and just happened to have ordered this one in a mix. Once I worked my way to wearing it, I loved it from the moment I put it on!!I've really active and have worn a sports watch 24/7 for nearly 25 years. When I dress up for a nice dinner, party or formal occassion, I struggle with finding the right watch that hides the noticeable tan line on my wrist, but still looks classy.For an inexpensive sports watch, this one looks fabulous for a night out in a dress! I've already had two friends notice it, and when I show them what I'm wearing they are shocked at how nice it looks.It's the perfect size and has all of the functions I need in a sports watch. I ordered two more so I have plenty of backups for a long time :)Read more by Jill Currey Shermer, Needed a waterproof watch for lake days.  This is perfect.  Ive been wearing it for a few years now and its still working great!  I can be in the lake all day just floating and it never skips a beat.Read more by Leah Thowson.
Brand: Anne Klein Women's Date Function Bracelet Watch, Model: Anne Klein Women's Date Function Bracelet Watch, Price: 25, Material: Metal, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: This watch is exactly what I was looking for. I have a very small wrist and I didn't want a ridiculous large face watch. This has a face no larger than a penny and looks feminine. I did have to have it sized smaller though because it still was a bit large. Now that it’s fixed it’s beautiful.Read more by Michelle C., Perfect to replace a similar watch thathas become worn and scratched.  It came ready-to-go with the time all set.  I liked that the adjustment link was simple to remove, so the watch now fits my arm very nicely.  I also like the versatility of the gold and silver tones to match other jewelry that I wear.Read more by Amazon Customer, Small and delicate!

Was already set to proper time, and keeps the correct time.Read more by Kat, I have a somewhat petite wrist, and while this watch is slightly oversized on me, I appreciate its bracelet-style aesthetic. I'm confident that it can be adjusted to fit snugly if necessary. In my search for a timepiece, I aimed for something simple, elegant, and budget-friendly with a touch of femininity, and this watch ticks all the boxes for me. I particularly adore the blend of metals, as it complements any jewelry I choose to pair it with. Additionally, the inclusion of a date display adds practicality to its charm, enhancing its functionality for everyday wear.Read more by Gabriela.
Brand: Timex Women's Cavatina Watch - TPearl Dial Gold-Tone Case, Model: Timex Women's Cavatina Watch - TPearl Dial Gold-Tone Case, Price: 39, Material: Stainless Steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Disclaimer: I have not personally used this product. I bought it as a present for a woman I've been helping who was physically beaten multiple times over the course of several years by both her ex-boyfriend and her sister. She grew up in an upper middle class family, but now is living penniless (literally) in a domestic abuse shelter. Her story and the psychological damage have been horrifying. I explain this so that readers will know the impact that this watch has had on her.*  *  *In order for me to give anything 5 stars, it has to fulfill several criteria: utility, safety, craftsmanship, and durability. This watch wins on all counts.As someone who grew up with Timex Triathlon watches, I know that these watches are durable. I'd love to see Timex come up with a cool logo to replace the clunky-looking TIMEX that they write on their watches. But few things are perfect.So, the woman I bought this for has a tiny wrist. That's because she is tiny. She's shorter than 5 feet and weighs less than 90 pounds. No, she's not anorexic, she's just very small. And she has the one of the smallest wrists I've ever seen on an adult. So, getting her a watch that doesn't require taking out links or punching holes in the wristband is nearly impossible.Just to give you an idea of the kind of family she grew up in, she was wearing a Tag Heuer watch until a few months ago. Tag Heuer watches are famous and expensive. I priced out her watch and it was easily over $1000. As a reference, I've never owned a watch that costed more than $60.But then she decided to seek justice in the U.S. court system against her highly abusive ex-boyfriend. Her family got frightened because his family is powerful, and they told her that if she continues they will completely cut her off. I didn't think they would actually do this, but they did. For the past year, she has received absolutely no money from them, and even though she has several sisters, none of them have called or even emailed her once since her family cut her off. That is why she has floated in and out of homeless shelters and domestic violence shelters. She wants to see her ex-boyfriend brought to justice.During that time, one guy attempted to kidnap and rape her, and another guy pointed a gun to her head and robbed her. All of this is documented by the police.And these things resulted in her crying in front of me as she gave me her Tag Heuer watch to safekeep for her until her living situation stabilizes. Then she started arriving at many of her appointments late because she no longer had a watch. I'm not talking about meetings with friends because she has no friends since this happened. I'm talking about meetings with the assistant DA's office, abuse counselors, and other people involved in trying to help her through this horrible ordeal.Finally, I decided to buy her a watch. Why? No, I'm not dating her. I'm just trying to show her that America still has decent people. Why is that important? Because she is not from this country, and many Americans were living in her apartment complex and heard her getting beaten for over a year by her ex-boyfriend. And still none of them called the police? So, yes, I feel a sense of duty to show her that not all Americans are selfish. I owe a lot to my parents on this one, because they raised me to help others and stick up for those who are too weak to fight for themselves.I spent a lot of time researching watches because I wanted to give her a watch that would make her feel great and help to rebuild her self-esteem. Translation: I didn't want to give her a cheap watch that reminds her of all the cheap stuff she has to get from donations that people give to her shelter.At the risk of sounding crazy, I spent far too many hours researching women's watches. Because she is so tiny, a round-faced watch doesn't look right on her. Also, her skin is very sensitive as evidenced by the occasional eczema on her neck. I used to see red spots near her watch, and I thought they were bug bites. But she told me that her skin has a reaction to the Tag Heuer metal band.Finally, I found this watch. After reading several of the Amazon reviews, I realized that this was the perfect watch for her. Why?1) the watch is not round-faced. It has a nice oval shape which is great for a small person2) the wristband is the only one I could find (out of the hundreds of watches I researched) that was made for a person with a small wrist. Even on her wrist, when she fastens the watch to her wrist, there are a couple of holes still remaining.3) the wristband is made of calfskin leather. So she has no allergic contact dermatitis reactions on her wrist anymore.4) the watch looks classy5) this watch is made by Timex, and I've never owned a bad Timex watch.6) I'm not rich, so I couldn't go out and spend hundreds of dollars on a watch.Honestly, I was nervous about giving her the watch. Why? Because I was replacing her Tag Heuer $1000+ watch with a watch that costs less than $25. Even though it was a gift, I wanted to give her something that said "quality" as part of her rehabilitation process. I've watched the way that her self-esteem has been eroded by her current living conditions. And it doesn't help that her abuser lives a fantastic life in a wonderful apartment in a great area.Her reaction when I gave it to her? She started crying. She was shocked that it was new. For the past year, she has been living on second-hand clothes and donated food that is often close to or past their expiration dates. Her shelter is in a low-income and dangerous area, so she is constantly looking over her shoulder when she walks to and from it. And her friends who know both her and the ex-boyfriend all avoid her (it's part of her country's culture).She slowly and very carefully took it out of the box as if it were a Rolex. Then she touched the inside of the leather band and was impressed with how smooth it was. When she asked me to touch the inside of the wristband, I was also impressed by its quality. She turned the watch over several times to look at its build quality which she liked, and then she was surprised when she put it on and it fit perfectly. Just before she put it on, she told me, "I'll probably have to punch a couple of holes in it because every watch I've had has a wristband that's too large." So, that made this watch even more special.I will never forget that moment. I guess I could say that it was a "Timex moment". It shows that there are still companies like Timex which build a great watch for a reasonable price. And at the risk of sounding campy, it makes me proud that an American company puts out such great products. And my hope in giving her an American watch is to convince her that the hell she endured for the four years in America while she was beaten by two people very close to her is not what we consider the "American Dream".She has been wearing the watch every day, and she loves it.One other thing worth noting is that Timex makes this watch with a brown wristband. I was thiking about getting that one from Amazon (Model # T2M567), but the hands are gold-colored which makes it hard to see under certain conditions. The hands on this model (T21912) are black which makes them highly visible as other reviewers have commented.Normally, I don't write incredibly long reviews like this. But sometimes an item gains a special life of its own because of the story and circumstances surrounding it.As for this woman, she still lives in a shelter. She still has to subsist on second-hand clothes and food, but at least she has a first-class watch, and when you're rebuilding your life, you have to start from something, don't you?I can't recommend this watch highly enough. I'm not sure that it's the best watch for much bigger women, but if you have a really small wrist, then this is the watch for you.P.S. try to remember at the end of reviews you like to click on the "Yes" button that a good review was helpful. This inspires good reviewers to write more often, and that helps all of us.lthough I'm not so crazy about the Timex logo (they don't have one and just use the standard name of the company on their watches).Read more by JK &#34;keeping it real&#34;, The media could not be loaded.I just got this watch and it fits perfectly! It’s lightweight, the gold coloring is beautiful, it seems to be pretty well made, and it wasn’t too crazy expensive. I’m not sure how water resistant it would be as it doesn’t seem built for intense waterworks… you can’t really adjust it as it’s a stretchy band. The band itself is a little scratchy on the skin so if you get annoyed by a little bit of roughness this isn’t for youRead more by Jen, Perfect for small wrists. Still big on mine but I don’t mind that it moves around. You can always make it smaller.  It’s very beautiful and daintyRead more by Brie, This is a cute watch for those of us with petite wrists.  It’s comfortable and stylish.  The face is a bit smaller than I expected but it’s still easy to read.  Timex has produced quality watches since their beginning, and continue to do so now. I gave it four stars because the gold trim around the face of the watch is very dull looking and doesn’t shine up so I wonder of how it will wear over time.  Good purchase - would recommend.Read more by cblue55, This a beautiful watch.  Dainty and looks great on the wrist.  Love the oval face.  Great price.

Packaging and overall item came in perfectly. Works great. Looks great and will work well with causal wear as well as formal wear. The price was right at 45% off at the time I purchased it. I almost bought the black and blue one, but my husband has enough watches lol.Read more by Kristina G., This watch looks fantastic—both sporty and elegant at the same time. I bought the black one, and I love the blue crystal face. I have small wrists, and it fits perfectly—not too large and not too small. I'm on the fifth hole of the band, which is right in the middle, so if you have large wrists, it might be too small for you. The leather is very thick, so it took a few days to break in, but hopefully it will last for a long time time.Now the negatives: the face is impossible to see in the dark. The hands are supposed to glow, but they don't. Even when I charge them with a light they only glow for about 30 seconds. Why Fossil doesn't use a material that truly glows in the dark I have no idea. How expensive can that material be? Also, the chronograph is totally useless. The first time I tried to use it, one of the hands wouldn't zero out. I have no plans to use it, so it's not that big of a deal, but I wish I'd never tried it because I'm kinda OCD, and the fact that the hands didn't go back to the top is gonna bug me a little bit.Other than that, I love this watch. My last Fossil lasted 20 years, so I really hope this one will last as long.Read more by Aladinsane1969.
Brand: Anne Klein Women's Resin Bracelet Watch, Model: Anne Klein Women's Resin Bracelet Watch, Price: 30, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I recently purchased the Anne Klein Women's Resin Bracelet Watch, and I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase! This watch is a perfect blend of elegance and functionality, making it an excellent addition to any wardrobe.Firstly, the design is simply stunning. The resin bracelet has a smooth, polished finish that looks incredibly chic and modern. It fits comfortably on my wrist and has a lightweight feel, which is perfect for all-day wear. The color is versatile and complements both casual and formal outfits beautifully.The watch face is easy to read, with clear and stylish hour markers. The gold-tone accents add a touch of luxury, making this watch look much more expensive than it actually is. I've received numerous compliments on it, and people are often surprised when I tell them it's an Anne Klein watch!In terms of functionality, this watch does not disappoint. The quartz movement keeps accurate time, and the clasp is secure, ensuring that the watch stays in place throughout the day. I also appreciate the water-resistant feature, which gives me peace of mind knowing that it's durable and can withstand minor splashes.Overall, I couldn't be happier with my Anne Klein Women's Resin Bracelet Watch. It's a beautiful, well-crafted timepiece that offers both style and reliability. If you're looking for a sophisticated watch that won't break the bank, I highly recommend this one. It's a fantastic value for the price and has quickly become my go-to accessory for any occasion!Read more by Md. Kamrul Hasan Khan, Love the color and style.

Great value for the price.Read more by Amazon Customer, I divorced my ex after 24 years of marriage... he had bought me a nice watch, something over $100... before the ink could dry on the paper that watch was donated to the local Good Will, a smile of freedom set upon my face as I drove away. There were multiple items I dropped off that beautiful autumn day. My adventures were only to begin.I bought my first watch, something small and dainty. Only to wear it out after a couple of years, it looked battered and broken, much like the changes I have gone through.  Yet, as I realize daily that change is a constant in life I too must make changes.In purchasing a new watch I read reviews,  considered what I liked in color and  style.  This watch has met all expectations.  The color is beautiful,  it's elegant and looks great with everything.  It's not heavy, and the clasp is not loose nor difficult to open.  I appreciate the compliments I have received,  it's nice to be noticed for the good things.Read more by Yvonne Ray, This watch is pretty but the adage you get what you pay for is definitely true. I would not wear this as an everyday watch. I think it might turn green or the coating/color would wear off. However, I bought it to wear once in a while when I wear rose gold jewelry. It is the quality of the jewelry you see in Macy’s on the center aisle tables in boxes during the holidays. I’m keeping it because that was what I expected.Read more by Goody2Shoes, My sister loves it! It looks so elegant that she's scared to use it everyday at school and in public haha.

Brand: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Model: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Price: 29, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I’m very pleased with this watch.  I’ve had it three weeks and it has been keeping good time.  I like the gold/brass color of the case and the clarity of the glass.  The face is easy to read and the cream face color is handsome and a nice contrast, less glaring than the white my previous Timex had.  Setting the date is not a problem, as some other reviews have stated.  Once you find the required “middle” position of the stem between all the way in and all the way out, it becomes pretty natural and is easy to remember.  Speaking of the date, I wish they kept the day of the week presentation that my previous Timex had, but that’s a relatively small disappointment.  The band is excellent.  It’s a soft suede-like leather that’s very flexible.  The trim stitching is very well done; straight, even,  and all finishings are secured and tucked away so that there are no loose ends or fraying looks.  The two belt loops, one fixed close behind the buckle and the other sliding further down the strap are great for keeping the strap close to the wrist.  All-in-all, a great buy for the price!Read more by KJ, Timex - hard to beat.  Watch arrived in new condition packaged in genuine plastic Timex display/packaging. A sticker on the package states: movement and assembly: Philippines, strap: China.  Regarding waterproofing, per the enclosed literature : " Is water resistant only as long as lens, buttons, and case remain intact;...is not a diver's watch (not to be used for diving );...and the caveat not to push any buttons whilst underwater. It also states 30 meter water resistance; without a screw down winding stem, I would be skeptical of that claim and I personally won't be submerging this particular watch.The watch strap is stamped "genuine leather upper"; appears to be good quality, stitched well and blemish free. Changing the date is simple: pull the stem out about less than midway and turn- left or right - until the desired date  is shown and push stem back in. The date window is not magnified and quite small, but the date is readable. There is an audible ticking sound. However, my hearing isn't all that hot anymore and I need to put it next to my ear to hear it.The whole watch is fairly light, not like an auto winding Swiss chronograph. The numerals and the hands are black and contrast well against the watch face, the second sweep hand is gold colored. Pushing the stem in activates the Indiglo feature: the watch face is backlight and the numerals and hands are boldly and easily readable.Someone asked if this a knockoff because it is so inexpensive; the Red Bull'seye Store sells the same watch for exactly the same price as on this site. These modest Timex watches are fairly inexpensive and this is no exception.So, if you are looking for an easy to read watch, night or day, doesn't cost too much offered by a brand that has been around since 1854,  and has a certain understated style, you might want to consider the Easy Reader watch collection line.Read more by Amazon Customer, Love my watch!  Nice look and easy to read day or night.Read more by Dennis Rutledge, I'm hard on watches as I use them for work.  They happen to get rough treatment.  I look to watches that have a crystal face to prevent scratches, and the comfort of a leather band, and easy to read in day or night.  This is not an heirloom watch, but it does just what I want it to do.  My only complaint, which is pretty must  across all brands, is the date is difficult to read anytime the lighting is low.  But if I run this watch through a wood chipper or rip it off my wrist on a rock...I won't cry of lose sleep over it.Read more by Jim H7uy, I've worn this style of Timex watches for many years & recently lost the one I had so I ordered a new one. I got this men's version for a more casual look & it came in the same day I found the old watch tucked down in the sofa cushions where the CAT hangs out. She stole my glitter!I love the larger face on the men's version without it being too large &, if I'm wearing a watch, it HAS to have Indiglo. It's been the most dependable watch I've come across for everyday wear & looks sleek & timeless, day to night.Read more by JojoB.
Brand: Casio Men's Vintage F91W-1 Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch, Model: Casio Men's Vintage F91W-1 Resin Strap Digital Sport Watch, Price: 16, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: This watch is perfect. It is super compact, super durable, super simple, and it costs as much as a fast food meal. It is the most sold non smart watch ever. If you need a watch and don’t need it to connect to your phone, there is literally no reason to buy any other watch, unless you are one of those weirdos that are obsessed with how watches look. It is also super intuitive and easy to use, and the alarm function works great as well. It has 7 years of battery life, which, at a $20 price point is less than one cent per day to always know the time, have a stopwatch, and have an alarm. At night, the light works great, and during the day, it is easily readable. I’ve already bought this watch twice, and I just got it again for an upcoming trip where I won’t have my phone. However, I’ve realized that having a watch is just better. Instead of fishing around in your pocket and getting sucked into YouTube, you can just glance at your wrist. Smart watches are dumb and gimmicky. Dumb watches are the way to go, and this is the best dumb watch out there. And if you are even considering buying an analog watch I genuinely don’t know how to help you. Can your analog watch set timers, have a 24 hour clock, have a stopwatch, or be super precise? I didn’t think so. And this watch is waterproof too.Read more by M. Sharp, Simple watch for a very low price but gets the job done. Fits and feels nice on the wrist with a retro look. Shows time digitally and has a built in stopwatch and alarm features.Read more by William Greene, I love this watch because of its simplicity. I consider this watch to be utilitarian and perfect for anyone who works with their hands, outdoor laborious work; basically a tradesman’s watch. It is basically the same watch from many years ago introduced by Casio that started the digital watch revolution. Its old style uniqueness is a conversation starter as well. The price and watch is such that you can put it through the wringer and not worry or feel bad about it. It certainly will hold up to whatever you throw at it. Yes, it’s small, the band could be better, but it’s actually just perfect how it is and what it is for. I love this watch and it makes me smile every time I look at it - a sort of nostalgic simplicity that is just there, kind of like a reliable friend. Great watch, but know your expectations and requirements before ordering to make sure it will be what you want.Read more by IT Gal, Its durable, accurate timekeeping, and inexpensive. The strap is way shorter than other casios/gshocks, so you cannot do that thing where you leave the clasp at the lowest hole so you can put on the watch and tighten it with one hand without looking. The resin kinda sucks compared to other casios/gshocks, but if you get it on sale (DONT buy this full price) its a good value. If this is at full price, id just get the gshock on amazon for like 40-50 bucks.Read more by Isaac De Silva, A lot of products I used to love have gone notably down in quality over the past few years. Not this one. The price is a bit higher but it's worth the buy. One watch lasts me at least three years of continuous use with no battery change (I haven't tried for longer so it may go longer than that still). I've never had any problems to speak of with these- they stand up to grime, wear and tear, jostling, and water up to a reasonable level (they're not meant to be submersed, but have survived my forgetting to take them off when jumping in the pool, ocean, or shower multiple times, and have never gotten damage from rain or splashes). Easy to clean, easy to take on and off. I have a bad metal allergy to some mental and have never had any issue with this watch, and the band is a soft rubber that resists chafing. 11/10 would recommend.Read more by Spiffy McPerson.

Reviews: I just received the Casio world time digital.  Very handsome and practical.  Watch feels comfortable and light but sturdy and well made.  (Case is plastic but bracelet is stainless.But case matches stainless well.) The digital display is large enough to read the time but the date image is rather small.  The analog display is not that useful but a nice-to-have. Setting the time and date is rather straight forward as it's similar to the GShocks.  Timekeeping seems accurate based on comparison with my phone's clock.  The bracelet feels very comfortable on my average size wrist.  Bracelet link adjustment is a chore as it requires fine manual dexterity and finger strength to manage the fold-over links.  The watch has a retro-vintage appeal and appearance.  For $35 it is a bargain and I recommend it if you're thinking of getting a digital wristwatch.  It's a Casio; so it is well made, simple to use and affordable.Read more by Amazon Customer, It's a really nice watch. I'm surprised by the quality and how much I like it. I had to remove a few links to get the metal wrist band just right. That said it's has plenty of adgusttments to get a nice fit. Feels nice and the screen is very clear and the stainless is very attractive. It feels like far higher quality then what you pay for. I'm still playing with the various settings but it's a really neat design and I think it's perfect for anyone who enjoys traveling since you can set multiple different timezones. The back light is plenty bright too with a orange glow. It has a lot going on. I was apprehensive about a watch under 30 bucks but it's worth it. I also think the metal band is well worth the extra 10 bucks. It says 10 year battery life on the housing but I guess we'll see. Lastly as far as fashion goes, I think it's nice and versatile. It looks just as good in your casual close as it does with your work attire and your Sunday best. I also like that it reads time down to the second. It's nice to know how accurately I can set this watch. How it will preform long term, I can't say but I'm optimistic judging from what I'm seeing. Anyway, I would recommend this to a friend. Heck, I'll probably buy it again as a gift.Read more by BlazingZipper, I got this as a gift for my partner, and he really loves it! Really nice quality and I feel looks more expensive than the price! Do be aware of sizing and you may need to adjust more than just initial adjustments, a watch link repair kit may be necessary.Read more by emily, Loving this throw back. Super sharp.

Got this watch to help me with my timing as that’s something I struggle with, and it does it’s job well! I can wear it in the shower, swimming, dealing with soupy garbages, and washing dishes, so it’s definitely durable! I like being able to set alarms and adjusting the time is a simple process. The little light you can use to illuminate the time is helpful as well! I also like the size of this lil watch! Not too small, not too bulky, and easy to see! I recommend this watch!Read more by Kenyatta Fultz, Really love the look and feel of this watch. Looks and feels like a g shock. I bought it for those reasons but also because the listing on Amazon shows a countdown timer. I do not see that function in the manual or on the Casio site. I am disappointed because that is how I narrowed my Casio choice down to this one. I would’ve purchased a different one(say the world timer or ae 1300) had I known this didn’t have the timer. I am a runner and not sold on a smart watch so I was hoping to use the timer on runs. For now I’ll use as everyday casual wear and still enjoy glancing at the time on a run vs. digging for my phone. Also female with small wrists and aside from the band being a tad long I feel the 42 mil is a great fit.Read more by Lauren Outlaw.

Reviews: I have used my cell phone instead of a watch since about 2001.  Decided to start wearing cheap, quartz watches again because I often find myself without my cell phone within reach at rehearsals, recording sessions, lawn-mowing, or work from home situations. Picked up a few Timexes and Casios around the same time. So far, I like this model the best for general use. The size of the time display is so easy to read that I have already started preferring it to comparable analog models.  I will mostly be looking to buy digital watches like this with big, simple displays from now on.I’m not James Bond, in spite of what you may have heard. I don’t want an expensive watch on my wrist that might make me a potential target for theft/robbery downtown or on a subway. If I get some paint on this one or it breaks while I’m trying to remove an oil filter, it would be no great loss.Use is fairly intuitive and it hasn’t lost or gained time in the few weeks I’ve owned it, unlike a Timex expedition analog model I got at the same time. After only a couple of weeks, the analog Timex expedition has lost about ten seconds already, which I admit I was surprised by.The only complaint I could possibly make about this watch is that the two LED’s are quite poor in comparison to Timex’s indiglo or the backlight used on much more expensive G-Shock models. But for how cheap and functional this model is, that is a completely unfair comparison. The lights work perfectly fine for me to see if I wake up in the middle of the night but can’t roll/reach over to check my phone due to a sleeping dog contorting my legs at the foot of the bed. Or if I fall asleep on the couch.I have mostly avoided getting it wet up until now, but I did accidentally leave it in the bathroom with the shower running a couple of times and no condensation formed on the inside of the face at all even though there was plenty of water vapor in the room. I also leave it on when washing my hands with no ill-effects.I’m very impressed by how simple and functional this watch is. These cheap, digitals are light years ahead of the Timex Ironman I owned as a kid. But it should be said- that $25-$35 Ironman I bought sometime around 1995 went body boarding, surfing, in the pool with me, and I showered with it on. That thing was basically water-PROOF and never had an issue in water less than 20ft. deep. I swam in Atlantic/East-Coast hurricanes with that thing and it even got tossed around in the salty surf with me. Also used it to time lap-swimming in Olympic-sized pools. I do not have the same confidence in this model, though I have no real rationale for that.The rubber strap was very uncomfortable on the old Ironman models and used to cause some really annoying, visible, skin irritation. I found G-shock straps of that era to be almost just as bad. That is not the case with these modern Casio polymer straps.I also despise those weird circles Casio, Armitron, etc. put on watch faces and take up a quarter of the face of the watch. This watch has NONE of that BS going on. The info on the watch face is SO bold and easy to read that I would definitely prefer it to all the G-shocks with those damned, senseless circles taking up so much of the display. PV cells excluded because they actually do serve a purpose. But here’s my view on all that: if the watch battery lasts even close to ten years, it will already outlast the battery/operation of the solar-powered, $150 G-Shock I once owned by a factor of YEARS. So I would still prefer this because legibility is far more important to me than photovoltaics.After a few weeks getting used to wearing a watch again for the first time in twenty years, I’ve really appreciated not having to dig my cell phone out of my pocket just to check the time/date. A weirdly subtle difference I would never have thought would matter.  But it does. I’m starting to really like Casios!I also like the hourly chime because otherwise I get lost and completely lose track of time while recording/producing. That could only backfire if the chime goes off in the vocal booth and ruins a take. Hasn’t happened yet, though.I’m also glad they make it in the desert-sand/beige color because I’m fair skinned so it doesn’t look like a giant thing on my wrist.At some point or other I will wake up exhausted and forget to take it off before I get in the shower. At that point I will update this review if water penetrates the buttons/gaskets/seals.Again, I am in disbelief at how excellent this watch is for the price. I hope they never discontinue this model until an identical “20 Year Battery” model is available.  But by then we’ll no doubt have flying cars, rocket-skates, jet packs, and digital, tattooed watches with veinous, indiglo epidermis.  Or more than the current, standard-issue, two to three computer chips implanted into in our visual cortex at birth.Just pick the color you like and buy the damned thing!Read more by Dru Ha, This is a great digital watch with a very large and easy to read display.It’s a Casio, so you know that it’s rugged and reliable.In fact, it keeps better time than watches costing thousands of dollars.The watch isn’t big on features but I really only need it for telling time .It has an outstanding price too and since it’s a Casio I expect that it will provide many years of excellent service.I have several at her Casio watches including expensive G-Shock models.The G’s are cool and they look great but I really don’t need all of their features.Also, those big watches  can be heavy and cumbersome on your wrist.Plus, this is the easiest to read Casio I have ever seen.If I could only have a single Casio watch, this is the one I’d pick.Highly, highly recommended .Read more by JRC, I like watches. I have an Apple Watch and another stainless steel “dress” watch.I wanted a watch I could wear when working out, or doing something physical that wasn’t going to buzz at me every 8 seconds and tell me what a good boy I was for taking 5 steps and remind me to breathe.Also, I think Apple Watches are great, but they’re a little bloated with useless features that, at the end of the day, I’ve never really used.I wanted something simple, easy to read, and able to take a beating. I wanted basic tactical features (like dual time zones, stop watch, alarms, timer, a clear second display, a light)This watch is easily comparable to the “G-Shock”.Not only does it do everything I want it to do, it looks incredible. It’s very stylish. Very clear, easy to read display at a glance and it fits great (I’m a guy, 5’7” with a small wrist circumference and got the “standard” size)I’ve tested the display light in the dark and it works great. Easily readable.Build quality seems excellent. Seems to be sturdy and durable. Doesn’t feel or look cheap by any means.Haven’t tested the water resistance yet but I don’t doubt it’s going to be fine.And finally, the price. The price is unbelievable for what you get. For the $20-25 price point you get way more features and value than you’d expect.Highly recommend!Read more by Lissy, I love Casio watches. They are tough, a good value and easy to read. I have had a few over the years. The battery life is ridiculously long. I have never had one die. The band is usually the first to go. I like this model because the band is made of a much stronger composite. However, the buckle is made of…. plastic. Why? Every other Casio I have owned had a metal buckle. Once the holes wear out that the pin sits in, it will pop off when horizontal pressure is applied. This is a high contact point on a watch so making out of plastic was not a good idea.Read more by Jeremy, I wear it to bed. So when I wake up I know the timeRead more by Mitch.
Brand: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Model: Timex Men's Easy Reader Watch, Price: 36, Material: Leather - Calfskin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: This was a gift for my father. He wanted an easy to read analog watch with day and date. Timex hit this one out of the park. It checked all boxes and has a great leather band. My Dad said it was easy to set up and "it is just the right size, not like those huge watches these days." So this was a win!Read more by ToddK, As a nurse, I have worn a Timex like this for years!! I like the quality, the size of the watch face & basic black numbers, with black clock arms. The indiglo light is perfect for seeing time in the dark. The band is comfortable. As a female, the watch looks stylish enough. I used to buy the yellow gold but have now retired and my hair is whitish grey so my choice now is the silver trim and I will continue to buy the Timex easy read watches.Read more by SLG, I wanted an analog watch for a long time and I’m so glad that my first choice, this watch, met my needs and my expectations. I am a woman but I’m using a man’s watch. It is sturdy. It is easy to read. It works. People ask if it’s a smart watch and I said no, it’s an analog watch, but I’m smart to have bought  it.Read more by EFW, I got it for my 75 yr old dad who thinks my obsession with watches is weird, but I love finding high value per dollar in ultra affordable watches too. My dad is frugal and likes that in his gifts, but low price doesn't have to mean junk. Also, he finds digitals tacky (so all the good low-end Casios were a no go).I found this Timex, "scratch & dent" on Amazon for just shy of $20, it arrived with  the box all beat up, the leather strap was not attached, and there were no spring bars. Still, the watch and strap were in brand new shape. I keep spare spring bars and it was easy to pop the strap on. Strap is on the short side, if you have larger than a 7.5" wrist, you'll probably need a different one (a NATO would work well on it, imo). Also, watch is old school size, 35mm, so it may seem small by today's standards.Highly legible day or night, it's got indiglo back light, even though that can wear on the battery if used a lot, it does look sharp in the dark, especially for this price point. Water resistant enough you don't have to worry about getting it wet, but I wouldn't go swimming or shower with it.Watch hit everything my dad likes, Timex has quality choices for a budget watch, and it was still fun for me to find. Timex is not a brand I normally look at, but dad loves it and seeing it in hand, I feel good about the purchase.I rate 4 stars because it is a lot of watch for $20-30 bucks. Though buyer beware with scratch & dent, if I didn't already have spare spring bars, I would have been irritated.Read more by merrckd, Nice look and feel.

Brand: Casio Men's Vintage A158WA-1 Water Resistant Digital Watch, Model: Casio Men's Vintage A158WA-1 Water Resistant Digital Watch, Price: 20, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Ha. This is a watch of contradictions. Cheap, yet well-made. Small, but noticeable. Old, but it feels so damn new. The watch performs flawlessly and despite mentions of it being retro, it is slick, modern, and even better looking in person.I will say, however, that I found the included contract unusual and potentially disturbing. When I placed the order, a prompt I’d never seen before appeared, inviting me to read and sign a contract. The document stated rather explicitly that the watch was for “handsome guys” and that I would not be permitted to wear it if I was a “major uggo”. Whatever. I signed the contract and placed the order. What happened next was the truly unexpected...Two days after placing the order, I received a knock on my door very late at night. I wish I could tell you what time it was, but I did not yet own the watch so it is impossible to say. I peered through my peephole and saw the figure of a tall man in a long coat. Slowly, I opened the door and asked him what he wanted. It’s then I noticed a wristwatch with the largest band I’d ever seen wrapped around his forehead. It was analog, so I couldn’t tell the time. The man introduced himself in a voice so quiet his words were almost drowned out by the ticking of his pretentious headwatch. “I’m with Casio,” he says. Or maybe “Dime sith mass E oh”. Hard to say. Still confused, I asked him again what he wanted. It was then that things took a turn for the worse.Uninvited, he stepped into my home and grabbed my face with his cold, dry, watch-tuning fingers. I tried to resist and found my body unresponsive. I’ve later theorized that his stupid, unreadable headwatch was in some way hypnotic and temporarily robbed me of my senses. By the dim porch light, he jerked my head around, carefully but methodically inspecting every angle of my face. It obviously wasn’t the first time he’d conducted this sick facial analysis.Suddenly, he stopped. With me still immobile and deathly frightened, he took a step back, gave me one final, fleeting check and muttered “Acceptable. Seven out of ten.” Having said this, he promptly tapped the dial on his gaudy headwatch and I fell to the ground, exhausted and overwhelmed by my experience, but released from his spell.The next thing I knew, it was morning and someone was calling for me. “Sir? Sir? Are you okay?” I looked up and saw my door was agape and the mail person stood above me, package in hand. Embarrassed to have been defeated by the mysterious man and his unfashionable watch, I simply nodded and began to stand. Obviously unsettled, the mail person handed me the package as I rose and told me to have a good day. It was my watch! And boy, what a watch it is!The moral of the story is this: the watch is incredible, and at $20 perhaps the finest entry-level watch money can buy.However, potential buyer, I caution you this: if you are any less than a 6.5 or 7 out of 10, don’t kid yourself. Perhaps you’ve got more a F91W or G-Shock type of face, and that’s nothing to feel bad about. Not everyone can be handsome! Just be careful - I’ve heard the watchman and his hideous headwatch do not look kindly upon the unattractive.Read more by Customer, It’s a classic digital watch. Stylish, light weight, affordable. Can’t be it.Read more by Cliff, I got the watch because I wanted to be able to have a digital clock with the second counter while I was at work. I have an apple watch but sometimes want to wear just a simple watch. The silver is a perfect color and hasn’t tarnished or anything for the time i’ve had it. The instructions were easy to use for setup but there was no instructions on how to adjust the size of the watch which was odd because it isn’t that obvious to figure out. After a short google search I was able to resize it fairly easy. I like that it shows the date information as well as it having a light for low light situations. I love the watch and can see it becoming my daily watch as it is very stylish too.Read more by John Taylor, Looks good on the wrist, tells you time, day and date of the month. Other functions are useful.Read more by Daniel, Sometimes it's really hard to beat the classics in terms of style. I bought this just to wear with some outfits and change up from my other watches.Pros: Easy to setup, easy to read in general lighting, easy to adjust band size on the fly without any tools. In my opinion, I don't think this specific style will ever not go with just a simple "day out" outfit. If you're a little exhausted of smart watches like I am, this can offer some reprieve- the features this has is standard digital watch features, but work really well.Cons: The light on this model has always been mediocre- If you are using your watch in a dark environment consistently, be mindful of that. It seems to only shine from the left side of the face, and can be hard to read. If you're a guy with arm hair, the default band seems to grab and pull a little more than other bands. Speaking of the band, if you have broader wrist/arms, this band and face may look a little out of place with how small they are.Overall, it's hard to beat the price point for the style of watch you're getting. They seem to last quite awhile as well. A great budget beginner watch to jump start a collection with.Read more by Michael Bridges.

Reviews: Coming from being an apple user and making the switch to android, this watch thus far is superior in almost every way in comparison. From the screen pixelation to sound quality to vibration intensity to superior app integrated. The samsung watch offers a variety of superior features which I think is definitely enticing enough for the switch. Coming from the apple watch it had the basics, the message replies, calls, apple pay, a few mediation and breathing apps, remote phone camera click and an ECG app that never worked. With the Samsung Galaxy watch 6 you're definitely getting better value per buck, you can use Google maps, a semi small but functional google web browser, a watch that measures your stress, gives you a decent review of how you slept from body temperature, heart rate and the cycles of sleep from rem to awake, a customizable watch face, Gmail, YouTube music, various work out apps, fitness and calorie tracking apps, games, a variety of music listening apps, etc. The only necessary cons I would mention about this watch is the voice to text feature isn't quite as consistent or picks up words correctly and the battery life is definitely a little short then my previous apple watch and the band that it comes with for us petite people is horrendous; I had it on the smallest hook and it was still about 3 inches above my wrist and would slide down, thankfully I bought a replacement band that is much better, however I would say for the value, quality and features this the watch to go.Read more by Trinity, Got it used and it's in great condition.I've only ever had fitbits in the past, and this is really nice in comparison. Especially since I have a Samsung phone. Set up was a breeze.The battery does drain after about 24hr,  if you're using the more advanced tracking capabilities. But I just charge it every morning while I'm showering. It charges extremely fast.I love the level of customization, and especially like that it automatically has everything from my phone connected, including my calendar and text messages. Very useful for my adhd forgetfulness. Even with reminders set in my phone, I still often miss them. This watch is always connected to my wrist, even if my phone is on silent or not on me, my watch always buzzes and let's me know. I've missed a lot fewer things because of it.Read more by Ryn, Very light and comfortable to wear. I've enjoyed using it so far and the only con this watch has is its battery life, but besides that it's an awesome smart watch.Read more by Mr.Dave, I've got a handful of pointers regarding this watch that you might heed before buying it.  That being said, I love the thing as of a few months owning it.Pros:1. The watch has many functions for health monitoring and is top of its class in that regard.2. It has the perfect sized face on it, not small at all but not too big.3. It feels sturdy all around, glass included.4. The amount of great digital faces available for free and for purchase (typically $1-$2 only) is awesome.5. It does GPS tracking for hiking and mountain bike rides that is used to display your path/location on a map in the Samsung Health app at the end of a workout, so you don't need to pay some obnoxious subscription for a 3rd party app like Strava to track that.6. Given that my last watch, a FitBit Sense, literally corroded and burned my wrist skin at the battery contact points, I'm all for the new non-electrical / "wireless" (magnetic) charging functionality of this one and will promote that as a reason to get one.Cons:1. It is hard to dial in the best watchband length/size with spare links. You either get it too loose and then the sensors don't work well (way inaccurate heart rate readings during workouts, lack of blood oxygen readings at night, etc), or you get it too tight and the watch clasp pops undone constantly as you go about your day or your hand circulation suffers while you're trying to sleep.  Unless you don't mind adjusting the links on your band twice per day or more (even in the middle of the night since everyone's wrists expand as we sleep), it might be best to go with a synthetic, flexible band that you can switch out to for when you're not dressed nicely on an outing or something (the band does at least look good).  I have done this and it is way easier to wear now.2. Bixby seems to randomly activate, which takes over your screen with her icon and a note that says "Listening". You have to swipe or push buttons to close out of this prompt every time it happens.3. Sometimes there is a delayed response time when switching activities on the watch such as going from your clock face to starting a biking workout, and it feels clunky.4. Randomly vibrates, often twice or three times within a 5 second period, without any notification on the screen as to why.5. When starting a hike in the watch OS, it seems to possibly take your last known elevation and then add whatever the difference is between that and your starting elevation, and it claims you've climbed that height within the workout you are doing at the moment, which is entirely erroneous.  That's what I want to believe it is doing, anyway - it could just be super glitchy and thinks you are actually thousands of feet higher than you really are at some point during the workout, due to satellite connectivity or data or something strange, and just jumps your workout to having done that kind of climb.6. The battery lasts about half as long as my FitBit Sense did prior to this, for some reason, despite having the face set to not be always on.7. The blood oxygen saturation sensor must have some kind of weak detector or can't record information when the watch is loosened up for sleep time (to prevent tightening during the night when our wrists swell a bit), because there are typically many gaps in the O2 data on the nightly chart.Takeaway:The watch is well worth it if it is on a good sale, so long as you know that it's not perfect (which the regular price would seem to indicate).Read more by A. Bombac, I recently upgraded to the Samsung Watch 6, finally replacing my old Samsung Gear, and I couldn’t be happier! The design is sleek, modern, and fits perfectly on my wrist. It’s a huge improvement in both style and comfort, making it a great accessory that I can wear all day.But what really stands out is the functionality. It seamlessly integrates with my phone, keeping me connected with notifications, calls, and messages. The health tracking features are more advanced than ever, and I love how user-friendly the interface is. Whether it’s tracking my steps, monitoring my heart rate, or even using the GPS during walks with my dog, Kobe, the Samsung Watch 6 has become an essential part of my daily routine.Overall, I’m loving the upgrade! It’s the perfect blend of looks and functionality, and I’m glad I made the switch.Read more by tracey somsouk.
Brand: Fossil Grant Men's Watch with Chronograph or Automatic Display and Genuine Leather or Stainless Steel Band, Model: Fossil Grant Men's Watch with Chronograph or Automatic Display and Genuine Leather or Stainless Steel Band, Price: 124, Material: Calfskin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I purchased the Fossil Grant Men’s watch with a chronograph display for my significant other, and it has quickly become his favorite accessory. From its classic design to its impressive functionality, this watch is truly a standout piece.The first thing that caught my eye was the stunning dial, which adds a unique and stylish touch to the traditional Grant design. It’s the perfect balance of elegance and modernity, making it suitable for any occasion.The chronograph display not only adds a practical element to the watch but also gives it a sporty edge that my significant other loves. Whether he’s timing laps at the track or simply keeping track of the time during a busy day, the chronograph feature comes in handy.The quality of the watch is evident in every detail, from the durable stainless steel case to the comfortable blue leather strap. It feels substantial on the wrist without being too heavy, and the craftsmanship is top-notch.But perhaps the best part of all is seeing the smile on my significant other’s face whenever he wears this watch. It’s clear that he truly loves it, and that’s the best endorsement I could ask for.Overall, I highly recommend the Fossil Grant Men’s watch to anyone in search of a stylish and reliable timepiece. Whether you’re buying it for yourself or as a gift for someone special, you can’t go wrong with this beautiful watch.Read more by Rumana, Beautiful watch and great quality!

But you can always buy a 22mm strap from them or other third party.  Overall quite happy with the purchase.Read more by Amitava Das, Just a good basic watch. Pretty versatile, could wear semi-casual with a button up shirt, to business formal with a suit. Nothing too fancy, but decent quality for the sale price. I paid $65 for the black band and bought another one with the brown band for $75. Fair prices, I wouldn’t pay more for that with this one. And they are different enough that it’s not the exact same watch with different bands either, the dial is not the same between the different variations, which is goodOnly drawback is it’s a little boring, but boring isn’t always bad. If you don’t want your watch to domineer your outfit and you’re not necessarily trying to make a bold statement or stand out all that much this is a nice one. It’s not cheap looking,  but won’t wow anyone either. Just a nice respectable basic watch for different occasionsRead more by JayBird23.

The movement is still in good working order and the body and band have held together with me wearing this watch almost every day. I don't know why the crystal fell out, but it did it without warning. Watch was under warranty, but the crystal is not covered??? $40 including shipping if I have Fossil fix it, which is much less then the watch, just a little frustrating. Over all though I'd say i probably had a fluke. In general the watch looks nice, holds up well, keeps good time, and if you get the leather band is comfortable to wear. The hands do glow in the dark, but not very bright, unless it sits in direct light for a bit. Over all a good watch, just expect some expense to maintain it somewhere along the way.Read more by Nathan.
Brand: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch – Leather Strap, Model: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 40mm Watch – Leather Strap, Price: 37, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Just got it in today. Looks and feels great. I will post in the future on any updates. The watch looks and feels very well made.  It’s not too heavy, and easily read. The Date window is pretty small. The watch band is very comfortable and seems durable. I absolutely Love the Luminous button, which looks great in low and dark lighting. This watch is the 40mm case size, which is the smallest watch I’ve ever owned. I have always bought much larger watches, i.e. 46mm and larger. So I am still getting used to the smaller watch, but it still is a great size. I’ve done a ton of research, and bought many watches, so this one seemed to have a lot of great reviews.  I will update my review, whether good or bad, in the future. Because I know how hard it is to find a good watch, for a decent price nowadays. So far, songoodRead more by Jody Lampin, There's a lot to be happy about with this watch.  It's got a nice weight, the color scheme (especially the orange second hand) is gorgeous.  The case is a brushed grey, a little lighter than gunmetal.  Simple and sleek! Can't remember the last time I had a watch with indiglo - love that! The watch brand seems like a decent quality leather band - it does take time to break in though, which I'd expect will lend to durability long term.Only minor downside is the lume on the hour/min hands is pretty weak.  But doesn't seem all that necessary when you have the indiglo lighting up the dial in low light.Time and Date setting was a breeze - pretty standard for anything with a crown.Read more by Stephen Korthals, Overall it's a very decent watch and I am satisfied with it, considering the price (I bought it on sale for around $45). I'm a little surprised that even my wife has mentioned a couple of times that it's a nice looking watch. Don't get me wrong, no one will mistake it for a $300 watch but I like how it looks and that's good enough for me. I wanted an inexpensive daily watch with Arabic numerals, easy to read and not too cluttered, with a little bit of field watch look and this watch met the need. For comparison's sake, the other option I was considering was a Seiko 5 field type watch, which would be fine but also at least 3 times more expensive and I didn't want another Japanese watch, I already have a Citizen Promaster so I'm good on that score and I didn't feel like coughing up a few hundred bucks for a Swiss automatic movement. I'll list my pros and cons and make it short:Pros:- good looking face, large Arabic numerals- size is about right for my personal taste, I don't like larger diameter watches but some people do- light weight was moderately important to me- accuracy, telling the time accurately is a watch's reason for being, and I think this is plenty accurate, about the same my Citizen Promaster or even a little tighter, really, but I'm not such an important person as to worry about a couple of seconds off here and there- solar, so no battery changes to fool around with the Expedition Solar version I purchasedCons: I don't have any strong negative opinions for this watch, particularly considering the price bracket we are in, but I will say- the lume is a little on the weak side, it doesn't last very long in my opinion so it would be hard to read at night or in a dark environment- height, I could wish it were a little thinner, it's not terrible but I just feel it sits a little taller than it has a right toTo sum it up again, it's very decent watch and I would give it 4 and 1/2 starsRead more by Harry GjonPlissken, Once you set the time on this, you make never interact with it again other than looking at it. It's solar. The tiniest bit of light keeps it going. There's nothing to break or go wrong. It's great looking and matches any outfit. It's waterproof. It's great looking, and versatile. You should still probably get a Casio Duro if you want a simple watch, but this is the same kind of thing but solar.Read more by Not S. A. Wilson, Yes, I'm old enough to remember the time revered motto of Timex. I ordered this watch for my daily wear watch to replace my 1930s Stuart. This Timex watch is an attractive, rugged and comfortable watch and is easy to read without all the dials and buttons of more expensive watches. Simple, Rugged and easy to read with luminous hands and the indiglo backlighting for night time viewing.Read more by Pendragon.
Brand: Anne Klein Women's Bracelet Watch, Model: Anne Klein Women's Bracelet Watch, Price: 28, Material: Stainless Steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Cute watch, I love the colors. I believe it’s water resistant, and I turn it off when I’m not using it to preserve the time retention. The battery seems to be holding up nicely. Pretty easy to read. This would be a great gift value! The size is a nice loose fit on me just how I like it.  Functional as well.Read more by Leslie, Most of the rectangular/boxy watches I’ve searched are either pricey or have quality issue. Then I came across to this. The size is perfect. I just removed the extra lock link and voila! It fits perfectly to my wrist. It was inside a box and carefully packed when I received it. And it is affordable. Now, I’m crossing my fingers that this watch will last.Read more by Raymond S Rollon, Gorgeous watch, especially for the price!! I receive so many compliments on it everyday and it is so comfortable that I often do not even take it off at night. I even accidentally wore it into a hot tub for about 30 minutes or so and had no issues with any water damage!There have only been 2 issues/downsides that I have experienced along the way: the first would be that I received damaged watches twice (did a return and repurchased 3 times) before receiving one that was in perfect condition on the 3rd try. So while I am very happy with my purchase now, just know that it may take a few tries to get your hands on a good/new quality one. The second disclaimer would be that the pins are SO DIFFICULT to remove. Much harder than any other watch I’ve adjusted in the past. You have to apply so much force which unfortunately makes the pins and sides of the links so easy to become damaged/scratched. Once removed for the first time though, the pins become SO easy to take out/put back, so I’m glad that I went through the effort to do so!If you can get through the difficulty of purchasing and adjusting, the watch is SO WORTH IT! Everyone asks where I bought it because it is so dainty and stunning! Definitely would buy again!Read more by Rebekah Tom, I bought the gold to use with my bracelets for fashion. Haven’t worn watch for few years. I love it. I love the skinny face look so I can stack with bracelets. Great quality price point. Only thing for me is that it is a little hard to undo the clasp when taking off. Will take couple tries using my nails to undo clasp. But at least I know it won’t come off. I did also come back and buy the two tone gold and silver for when I wear silver jewelry.Read more by ms.kat, I bought this watch on amazon prime day and the quality for the price is astounding. The watch itself is very cute. I have smaller wrists and the watch doesn't look too big on them. You can adjust the band to fit your wrist perfectly. I've hit the surface of the watch and I've worn it while sweating but the surface hasn't scratched nor has the gold started to discolor! I would definitely recommend.Read more by Samantha Fulgium.
Brand: Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200 M WR Black Dive Watch (MDV106-1A), Model: Casio Men's MDV106-1AV 200 M WR Black Dive Watch (MDV106-1A), Price: 52, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: As my eyesight gets worse with age, I was looking for a durable, waterproof, easy-to-read watch with a simple timer that looked great on my wrist.  I own both a Fitbit and Apple watch – I was getting tired of being tracked all the time and getting notifications about everything (which yes, I know can be adjusted).  I’ve owned Casio watches before and still have a G-Shock digital that’s been running great for almost 20 years, so after reading many reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, it was an easy decision to make.I went with the black face and bezel model, although you really can’t go wrong with any of the other colors offered.  It’s a classic diving watch that, in my opinion, looks sturdy, cleaner and more elegant than some of the more expensive competitors.  Given Casio’s proven durability over the decades and the price point of this particular watch, you can't miss with this one.There are a ton of You Tube videos and review articles online about this diver (which is a bit of a cult classic it seems) – the vast majority of which are overwhelmingly positive, so I won’t add much more here that hasn’t already been stated there.  One common “complaint” that I noticed though is regarding the stock watchband.  Many are critical of it, but I tend to disagree.I did take the advice of some and tried a few different aftermarket bands – the Barton elite silicone, a Ritchie classic leather band, and a Ritchie nylon NATO strap (all available on Amazon).  With the exception of the NATO, I personally found the stock Casio diver band the watch comes with to be the most comfortable of the others tried – not taking away from or knocking the others by any means, it’s just a “why spend the extra money” type thing for a $50-ish watch.  Simply a personal thing…Re the NATO strap in my pics:  I did keep the Ritchie Premium Nylon strap to compliment the watch.  It really does dress it up and make the timepiece pop for more “formal” occasions if you will – and very comfortable too.  For everyday use though, the stock classic diver-style band turned out to be the most practical for me – one I recommend over aftermarket options and especially for those in the trades or who are knocking around on the beach, out hunting, at the lake, etc.If I had to be critical of any aspect of this watch, it would be the luminescent capacity of the hands and markers – something also frequently mentioned in many of the reviews I read online.  It’s marginal at best.  When blasted with high intensity light, the markers glow brilliantly initially, but it does seem to fade quick.  I mention it because if this is an important feature for you night owls, it is something to consider. For me, it’s acceptable and not enough of a factor for me to change my rating of the piece.Bottom line is that I highly recommend this waterproof diver.  It’s superior quality with Casio durability and reliability at a price that can’t be beat.  It keeps d***-near perfect time and doesn’t have to be charged on a daily basis or wound ever – just a simple, inexpensive battery keeps it going for a couple of years.  You will not be disappointed with this one!  Thx, DTEdit 2/2/2024:  A word on timekeeping:  Having owned this watch for a while now, it does GAIN a few seconds every month.  I go to www.time.gov to set adjust time every now and then...  It's still more accurate than my other watches though - amazing considering this is a $50-ish dollar piece.  Highly recommend this watch!Read more by VAARK, This watch, especially for the price is amazing. Time Keeping is amazingly accurate and 200m/20 atm water resistance is really good along with the screw down crown. Its not over done on the dial and is a nice purely simple diver watch with a moving bezel and date window. $57 and its a great looking watch that goes with casual or a bit more dressed up clothing. The main thing I'd recommend changing is the watch comes with a 22mm watch strap. The rubber one that comes with it is a bit cheap feeling, but its easy to change with a small flathead or correct watch toolkit as amazon sells, I had an extra nylon front/leather back (wrist side) sitting around on a watch i wasn't wearing and was same 22mm, swapped them around not only is the nylon one more comfortable, it looks better too. Images in review show the casio swapped with the other watch i swapped the bands on, the silver case is the casio with the band that came factory from the black case one with the casio factory strap, as i don't wear that particular watch as often as the casio. This casio is comfortable and very accurate as well as seeming to be very sturdily built.Read more by Kevin Matthew Spears, I wanted a weekend beater for surfing and off-road motorcycling. It had to be big-faced and easy to read at a glance. No digital crap, please. I needed another watch like a hole in the head. I have some really nice watches and I'm not a collector. But since I am single and nobody around to tell me no, I got it. Great value for the price, just an impeccable knockout of the Rolex Submariner of old that I always envied.  As soon as I got it as set the time and took it surfing.  I banged it around, held it under water, sprayed with a fire hose, took a shower with it, and just hammered it with abuse as much as I could so I could return it promptly.  No success; I could not destroy it. It still holds time to the millisecond with no fogging and no problems.  Just a big hunk of phat shiny blissful steel with black highlights, a discrete second-hand, a tight rotating bezel and a light rubber wristband.  For $37 this is a steal.  I might just hang up my Tag Heuer and Victorinox watches until this thing lets me down, which may be a while.  Very easy to read at a glance which is why I got it. Not too heavy, really shiny, Big and fat. Classic good looks.UPDATE: \December 5, 2014.\ 'still looks brand new, has not lost even 1-second of time. How can this be more accurate than my $1,500 dollar Tag Heuer???? I've worn it every day since I got it..  :) The rotating bezel is still tight, firm and crisp and you can update the calendar without stopping the second hand. This should cost a lot more.UPDATE: \October 17, 2015.\ Replaced the battery finally, Still holds the time to the millisecond and not a scratch on the bezel or the steel. Every short month I calibrate it to the atomic clock NHIST in Colorado and it has never failed to be dead nuts on. The rubber wristband and the chrome look like brand new. I have really abused this thing and it just laughs at me.UPDATE \April 6, 2016 \ The band finally gave out, I replaced it at a watch store for $10 with the exact same type. I went to set it to the atomic clock, and did not need to adjust the time at all. Right on the money; still keeping perfect time. Still looks like day 1.UPDATE \Sept 27, 2016\ I hate this watch, I'm looking for a reason not to wear it anymore, It just keeps going on and on and looking brand new. Now all my other watches have had battery death from neglect, Why did I ever buy anything else? I wear a Casio over a Rolex and can't find any reason to switch back. My VW gets the job done and my Rolls Royce sits in the garage. fooey.Update 8/16/2023 OMG, will this thing finally just die???!! No, just keeps time to the second, looking fresh as the day I bought it. I'm getting tired of seeing the same glorious glistening crystal smerking at my doubt and disbelief 🫢. I way underpaid, it way over performs.  Crap, I'm such a fickle and unappreciative 1st world funk- monkey.Read more by Bjoerk, Read many good reviews.  Was still a bit sceptical given the price point.  Well...the reviews were right.  This is a nice watch! Hands and bezel align correctly.  Finish is good.  Nice weight.  Sits well on the wrist.

Thank you Casio!Read more by Todd Tatton, Maravilhoso ,adorei apesar do tamanho (44mm) , não parece tão grande no pulsoRead more by Fernando.

Reviews: This watch is very stylish. It’s quite heavy and solid. The weight gives one a feeling of durability. Set was intuitive and easy. I did remove one link in the band to better fit my wrist.The three smaller dials are 24-hour military time keeper, a seconds-based stopwatch, as well as a minutes-based stopwatch.

Wouldn't even consider a G-Shocks, as I'm ex-military, and G-Shocks just remind me of the service. So... Ended up buying this little watch, and it really is much better than a G-Shock. Pros:1. The watch is 38 mm and fits perfectly on my 6.1" wrist.2. Strap is comfortable.3. Legibility is great, large readable digits.4. Has 3 alarm clocks, each with a different tone.5. Lights keep working as long as you're pressing  buttons. That means you can finish setting whatever you need, without needing to press for lights again. Lights turn off several seconds after last press.6. Buttons are large and comfortable.7. Helps me use my smartphone less, as I'm not reaching for it anymore to tell the time and set timers.8. Unused features can be completely turned off, so they don't clutter the interface.Cons-1. Alarm clock is pretty loud. But I'm a deep sleeper, and I don't completely trust it to wake me up. Maybe if I set all 3 alarms consecutively, it might wake me up.2. Rarely, the strap pinches my arm hair.3. The occasion mode is pretty useless now that we have smartphones (But can be completely turned off).Overall really impressed with this watch, all the features feel really well thought out. I would highly recommend buying.Read more by Dean, I go through alot of watches in the last 30+ years. This one seems to be the best so far. The timer is a bit tricky so I stopped using it.

Brand: Casio FT500WC-5BVCF Men's Forester Sport Watch with Nylon Band, Model: Casio FT500WC-5BVCF Men's Forester Sport Watch with Nylon Band, Price: 21, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Excellent price for an accurate quartz watch that does everything a field watch should do (and more). The small LED at the 6 o'clock position is plenty bright to read the dial - no more wishing that cheap luminous hands and numerals kept their luminosity in the darkness. The 24-hour numerals are a bit small but, hey, if you can't add 12 to the current time, you probably ought not worry about military time anyway. The strap is velcro, so no fussing around with a cheap pin buckle. The date? Frankly, who needs that in a field watch anyway - but, if you want to know the date, there it is for you. The off-white dial complements the black and brown of the plastic case. The resin (AKA acrylic or plastic) crystal will probably get pretty scratched as you work in the yard or hike along brushy paths, but it's pretty easily buffed out if you want to restore the clarity. Looks great with jeans or khaki for a very casual look. A great weekend watch when you've no one to impress but yourself for making such a great buy!Read more by Elliot, I have owned several “field watch” style analog watches, most recently a metal Timex Expedition, which is a handsome military style watch. While well built, the Timex is heavy. I tried this Casio model because the weight, about half of the Timex’s, was one of the lowest weights of any analog watch available on Amazon, with the exception of perhaps a Swatch or the tiny Swatch-like Casio which the Pope wears (Google that if you don’t believe me). The all plastic design is what leads to this low weight.After wearing it for three days, I can say this watch is great & exactly what I expected. Well under 40mm across, so it’s not large on my average sized wrist. Astoundingly bright light (with a really cool multi-second fade, which I’ve never seen on a watch). And again, so lightweight you’re not even aware of its presence. Some people have asked if the hands are luminous; they are not.The most puzzling thing about this watch was the strap that came with it. Very funny looking and bulky for everyday wear. The “leather” parts of the band were clearly shiny vinyl, which gave the band a cheap look. But I will say that the supplied band would probably work well for people who use the watch for camping, hiking, canoeing, etc. The band’s Velcro was very secure and easily adjustable to any lengthy and it would be quite easy to quickly put the watch over a jacket while cold weather fly fishing or something like that. Also the supplied strap seems like it would dry fast.But because I planned to wear it was an everyday non-outdoorsy watch, I wanted to switch to a NATO strap, of which I have several. Here’s where I’d caution anyone planning to switch straps as I did. Most “lug widths” on watches are *even* millimeter widths, with 18, 20 & 22 being the most common, and 20mm being the most common of all for Timexes, Seikos, Citizens, etc. This watch is a 19mm lug width. Quite unusual. Straps, NATO and otherwise, with odd widths are difficult to find, but I happened to have one (the one featured in the photo). Is this lug width issue a huge deal? No. If you wanted to switch the watch to a NATO strap, and couldn’t find a 19mm, an 18 or 20 would work (with the former showing a bit of the metal pins and the latter being a snug fit).But aside from the weird band issue — which worked out well for me — this is a perfect watch for a perfect price. Like many Casios, you’re talking about approximately $20 for a watch which will likely last years.** One final note: I can’t vouch for the accuracy of this, but one YouTube review of this watch said it has two batteries— one for the quartz movement and another for the light. If this is true, this might be a reason to just get a brand new watch when the batteries die, since replacement of two batteries could equal the cost of the watch, especially if a jeweler were to charge you $20ish for installation of the two.Read more by Ian O. Smith, I kinda regret the Velcro band, and the addition of an unfixed band loop is silly since it's Velcro.  But I wear it every day and I love its practical build and its color scheme and sweet amber fading light.Read more by John G. Drummond, I was pleasantly surprised by this sub $20 dollar watch. I purchased this watch for knocking around.However it's appearance is quite nice. The dial has a nice easy to read face that is quite bright in daylight. The led light for the dial is very bright and you won't have any problems in reading the dial using this light at night. The watch claims to be water resistant. I already had it exposed to a light rain without any problems. I particularly like the velcro band. It allows you to adjust the band to fit your wrist exactly. No more bands sliding down your wrist because the holes in the band don't quite fit! Of course the quartz movement keeps perfect time. I also like the fact that the back of the watch can be removed with a fine point phillips driver making battery replacement easier. In summation I rate this watch a good value for the money.Read more by upwasik, The media could not be loaded.This is a very simple watch. It has a crown to pull out with a fingernail. The crown has 2 detents, the 1st for the day setting which has a satisfying click for each date. The 2nd detent is for the time. When you have the watch set where you want, fully press the crown and this Casio will the hold the time as close as possible for months.It's not just a Casio, it's a Casio analog, it's a tank.The biggest reasons to love this watch are for the comfort and ease of use of the nylon and velcro strap. Also, the backlight on this watch is fantastic.My mom bought me this watch in around 2001 because my first car did not have a clock. So I kept a version of this Forester around the shifter column and kept it there for almost 4 years.That older Forester had a different backlight, which was great, but these new Foresters have an LED which is superior. They both had a "timeout/dimming" function to them that is similar and I think is unique.I love watches and especially Casio and some more "flavorful" options like data banks and G-Shocks. But this a real great simple and rugged watch. You won't be disappointed to wear this everyday or add to a collection.Read more by SpaceAgeGamer.
Brand: Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Black Resin Strap Watch, Model: Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Black Resin Strap Watch, Price: 15, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I recently bought the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch with a Black Resin Band and I must say, it has exceeded my expectations. This timepiece beautifully combines simplicity with reliability.The design is classic and minimalistic, perfect for everyday wear or even for a more formal setting. The black resin band is comfortable on the wrist and feels durable enough for daily use. The analog display is clear and easy to read, making time-telling effortless.What really stands out about this watch is its reliability. Casio is known for crafting timepieces that last, and this watch is no exception. It has been keeping accurate time since the moment I started wearing it, which is crucial for me in a watch.Moreover, its water-resistant feature has proven handy in various situations, giving me peace of mind during unexpected weather changes or accidental splashes.For its affordable price, the quality and functionality of this Casio watch are outstanding. It's a fantastic value for the money and I couldn't be happier with my purchase.If you're in search of a no-nonsense, dependable watch that won't break the bank, I highly recommend considering the Casio Men's MQ24-7B2 Analog Watch. It's a reliable companion that gets the job done while adding a touch of understated style to any outfit. Overall, a very satisfying purchase that I would gladly recommend to others.Read more by Eduardo Cuello Suazo, Seeing as I have a tendency to lose watches, I wanted to get one that wasn't too expensive. I was positively surprised to find one on Amazon that met my criteria (simple modern design, clearly legible analog dial, reputable brand) for only $10. As far as I can tell, they are cheap not because they are shoddy but simply because they are simple.The watch has a polyurethane strap, a stainless steel back, and a hard plastic front ("crystal"). According to the markings, it is assembled ("cased") in China, but the mechanism ("movement") is made in Japan. The case is a bog standard model so if you want to put on a different strap you can easily do that. The strap is quite comfortable for a plastic strap, but it's a bit on the short side. It fits around my wrist, but only barely.It's marked as "water resistant," which does not mean you should go swimming with it, but it should be able to withstand some rain or a quick shower. In my experience, if you replace the battery in watches like this it's going to take more than $10 worth of effort to get it back to being similarly water resistant, especially as far as condensation is concerned. For high-end watches it's worth having the battery replaced by somebody who knows how to properly put the waterproofing seal back in, but for a $10 watch, unless you live in Arizona and never wash your hands, you probably want to just replace the whole watch when the battery runs out.Within a day of buying this watch I actually received a compliment about my nice-looking new watch. And I agree. Casio did not attempt to make their $10 watch look like a $100 watch with chrome-plated plastic and other such gimmicks. They produced a simple design that makes the most of the low-end materials at end rather than making a feeble attempt at imitating more expensive materials. And it works.I don't expect this watch to be an heirloom any time soon, but it tells the time and it actually doesn't look half bad, all for ten bucks. Congratulations, Casio! Awesome product!Read more by J. J. Weel, This is an excellent watch, this watch is excellent when using a formal and semiformal outfit. The good thing is that this watch is a simple and classic watch, with good colors which are black and white. However I expected the watch to be a little bit bigger, it is a small watch in comparison to other watches. I have used it like 4 times and I really like it is a comfy watch and really simple. Also it comes with a really nice stand for the watch and the price is very good for this watch. In Summary its a great watch mostly for teenagers and gentleman.Read more by manuel perez, Casio have always been a fairly reliable brand, and this watch was great. I ordered it for a friend as a gift, and although it was a little small, it was quite stylish and works well. It has a bit of a retro vibe to it and looks great with many outfits. The numbers are big and easy to read.It's water resistant and comes with a battery, and I'm not sure how long the battery will last, but it's a great price.Read more by Jeffrey Lou, Good watch at reasonable price.

Brand: IOWODO Smart Watch for Men Women - 1.85''HD Screen with Make and Answer Calls, with AI Voice Assistant, SpO2/Heart Rate/Sleep Monitor, 100+ Sports Modes, Smartwatch for Android and iOS (2 Straps), Model: IOWODO Smart Watch for Men Women - 1.85''HD Screen with Make and Answer Calls, with AI Voice Assistant, SpO2/Heart Rate/Sleep Monitor, 100+ Sports Modes, Smartwatch for Android and iOS (2 Straps), Price: 26, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I’ve been wanting a smart watch for a while now yet couldn’t justify the $200-$500 price point of an apple watch. I came across this product and with it being sub 50 bucks I thought it’s worth the risk. I got it just a couple days after ordering and once it arrived it was beyond what my expectations were. The interface is way better than I thought I’d be and has plenty of applications for anything you’d need. From the the music to the health and bpm tracker that’s accurate and the ability to send messages and make calls. The sound quality is very clear and the touch screen is super responsive. I hardly need to charge it because of how long the battery lasts and it’s neat that comes with and charged with a magnetic charger. Both wrist bands that it comes with are extremely comfortable and secure. It’s really convenient that it is waterproof so washing my hands with it on is not a problem. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants an affordable smart watch with all the features of something that’s 10 times the price. I even bought one for my mom as a gift and she loves it.Read more by Andrew, This watches is cute, functional, can answer calls and can make calls via watches, receive messages, have contacts, screen can be chosen from many options . Charging fast, connecting very easily via bluetooth! Application is great! Easy to connect to iPhone, and Samsung phones we have!The price is good and affordable!I bought for me gray watches and for my husband black one! My husband and me like these wrist watches very much!Thank you!I recommend it to my friends!Read more by svetana, I was so surprised when I ordered this watch because it was an amazing price for a great quality watch. It is very comfortable to wear, and comes with extra band, and acts just like an Apple Watch. Has so many apps to use, clear to read, and charges so fast! The battery literally lasts for like three or four weeks without having to charge it again which is such a plus. Has time passer games that work really well, and is just a great watch. It also has so many free and cool watch faces of all styles on the app to choose from, which helps you customize your r30 pro better! Great fitness tracker and has endless  exercise options! The only cons to this watch is that it cannot connect to an iPad, and that it is not waterproof. Make sure to take your watch off before jumping into the pool or lake, or taking a shower. Also, Siri, receiving messages, and calling does not work when your phone is not right by you, because those features only work with Bluetooth. Overall I am very happy with this smart watch, it does its job well!Read more by S. Jennison, Overall, the watch is pretty good. It is a great Apple Watch dupe. Looks just like it. Looks wise, the watch is nice. I wear it all day and it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and it’s comfortable and light enough to wear overnight. It measures my sleep well. I mainly got the watch to keep track of my health, something that it does perfectly. It keeps track of my steps, heartbeat, stress, etc. It also connected to my iPhone with no problem through Bluetooth. I have been getting all my alerts and phone calls. The battery life is also great. I’ve had the watch for about 6 days and I haven’t had to recharge it at all. I also love that I can customize the watch face and change out the watch band as it’s compatible with Apple Watch bands.The only issue I have with the watch is that sometimes it doesn’t sync well with some of the features on my phone. There are times when it displays the wrong time and/or the weather function simply doesn’t register. The other issue I have is the app that you have to download to read and keep track of your health measures. It didn’t let me put in my correct weight or birthdate when I was initially entering my information. I had to log in later to change everything, and it finally let me fix it. These issues aren’t a major problem and I am keeping the watch despite them. I am satisfied with my purchase. If there was an option to give this watch 4.5 stars, that would be my true rating.Read more by Kandice N., Setup with connecting to my phone was simple, you will get text message notifications if you are synced to your phone.  Compared to my previous smartwatch It's very lightweight given that there are no metal components, which was a plus for me.It comes interchangable with the classic rubber wrist strap or Velcro wrist strap which is my personal favorite as removal and applying is simple and fast. Battery life is as expected with majority smart watches, very long while in use and on standby.Many functions, from the basics such as heart rate, blood oxygen, step counter, weather , calculator, timer, and new for me the stress level reader also with a wide range of sports modes to choose from. Iv had this for a couple weeks now and have had no issues thus far even with the extreme heat, rain, and wind, it still works just as it did on day one. Other than the light weight weight and style comparisons, I don't see much of a difference between this smart watch and the more pricer ones. Overall worth the price and would really recommend.Read more by Trevel.

The dial is easy to read (day/night), feels solid with just the right amount of heft... I even like the wristband. I can't remember the last time I didn't feel the need to order a separate NATO style wristband for a new watch purchase (I average around 2 years per watch before something catastrophic happens). If I had to say something negative, it is a little hard to read the date. That's a common complaint with me though and not worth deducting a star over. Comes nicely packaged in it's own cloth envelope.Read more by snailmartyr.
Brand: Amazfit T-Rex 3 Rugged/Military Smart Watch 48mm, GPS (with Privacy), Offline Maps, Long Battery Life,328 Feet Water-Resistant, 170 Fitness/Sport Modes, AI, Voice Control, for Android or iPhone, Black, Model: Amazfit T-Rex 3 Rugged/Military Smart Watch 48mm, GPS (with Privacy), Offline Maps, Long Battery Life,328 Feet Water-Resistant, 170 Fitness/Sport Modes, AI, Voice Control, for Android or iPhone, Black, Price: 279, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I watched many, many reviews on many, many watches before making this decision.  Awhile back, I owned a fossil smart watch.  They are now discontinuing those.  I wanted to make the jump to something that had built in GPS (and ability for downloading offline maps) for when I am hiking in the woods on camping trips.  I also wanted accurate heart rate, and vo2 sensors.  Baromiters, altimeters, and compass are also handy.Naturally, I looked at Garmin, Samsung, even google for smart watches.  I found 3 main problems when looking at these:1) They are all very expensive for the feature set I wanted.2) They all lack the battery life I need to be safe in the woods.3) When compared side by side to the watches by Amazfit, they really weren't better enough to even come close to justifying the price.  On top of that, this battery on the Trex3 is absolutely insane!Things I was worried about concerning the Trex 3 was the size of the watch.  In the pictures I saw in reviews, the thing looked ridiculously large on a wrist.  Well, those pictures must have just been a bad angle because this thing barely larger than my wonderful old fossil smart watch.  It looks great and I won't feel like an idiot wearing it to my upcoming business conference :) .The Zepp app took a minute or two to figure out (and quite a while to download for some reason)  but it is wonderful.  Great metrics from my hikes and runs on the watch and the app.The built in gps is nearly flawless.  It both locates quickly and tracks precisely. I freakin' love it.Even the sleep tracking this first week seemed pretty damn accurate.  That was a real shock and we'll see if it continues, but I am hopeful.The free watch faces to choose from are all cool and range from tacticool to business casual cool to Harvey in Suits cool.The watch band (mine was the red one and the Trex3 comes with it, a liquid silicone band) is SOOO comfortable. The watch feels light on my wrist.  I may swap this band out for a 22mm leather one from my fossil for the upcoming business conference. (the Trex3 comes with an adapter for the quick release watch bands we all know and love).A very long time ago (i think about 5 or 6 years ago) I bought a cheap Amazfit fitness tracker watch  that cost like 50 bucks.  It was just OK.  Not great, and the app kinda sucked.  My lord, I had no idea just how far this innovative company has come.  Their whole line of watches since then look pretty damn good.  And this rugged Trex3?  It's my dream come true.  Worth every penny so far.  For $270 bucks? Just get it.  Garmin and Samsung won't miss your $700 investment in their products.  And you won't miss a beat.  Or their vastly inferior battery life.Read more by Danny McKeever, As a Garmin Enduro2 owner, I wanted something smaller, lighter, and brighter for everyday use.  This watch, at 1/4 the price of the current Fenix lineup, leaves me little need to go back to my Enduro2 at all.  It is much more comfortable on the wrist, has superb battery stamina, excellent GPS accuracy, and is very well built, even if it lacks the titanium and sapphire glass of the Enduro. The only feature I really miss is the dedicated flashlight.  But the screen on the T-Rex 3, at 2000 nits, does a respectable job there as well.  And it is bright enough to be easily legible in direct sunlight.Highly recommended.Read more by Philly Steve, This new watch has a cool look and great function.I love the downloadable map. I go hiking often so it is very helpful especially in the outdoor when I have no signal. I can still find direction easily.I also love the training section as well. There are many different types of sports/workout I can choose from and each training would have its measurement preset in the watch to measure various results. After the workout, I can read the result and details on my app. The data shows in graph, it is very easy to read and see the trend. I can also adjust my goal based on the result.There are also many other mini programs I can download to the app. For example, yoga and stretch courses, diet monitoring, pill reminder, and many more watch faces. Overall experience with the app and the watch is nice. It is very easy to navigate. The touch screen is sensing well too.The package is nice. The watch and all the accessories are packed in one small quality box nicely. The manual doesn’t have many information which is nice. I don’t like to read that. All the information is on the app. Just follow the setup on app step by step. It is very easy and quick to setup. The Bluetooth connection between the watch and the app is also quick. Charging is very fast as well. I would recommend this watch especially if you love training or outdoor.Read more by bufan chiu, I own Fenix 7, been using both for my exercise. To be honest there isn't a great a difference for me and the watch is $600 cheaper. Screen is better, battery lasts almost as long. Missing a couple of metrics, one that I use is respiration on the garmin, T-Rex 3 has the others. Yes it’s mostly plastic but it still seem well built(time will tell)I placed a screen projector on it so not all that worried about the screen. The shape of the watch is a bit different but that doesn’t bother me. For me, it seems more comfortable and is a bit thinner. All the information was pretty close to the garmin after my trek. The garmin Had to crank down the strap so the watch wouldn’t slip, the T-Rex 3 I didn’t. The screen is easy to view but so is the garmin in sunlight, in shade different ballgame. I’m not an athletic so the different between these two watches are really minimal for me. Changing the band is different. To put it bluntly the Garmin is going in the drawer.Would I recommend this watch, if you’re not trying to keep up with Mr Jones, yes The T-Rex is a better deal, at least for meRead more by E7Grunt, Looks and works greatRead more by Santiago.

Reviews: First off I am not a bot. This is a real review by just a regular normal guy. This is a really good watch for the money. It has all the features of a high end smartwatch but without the high cost. It looks nice while wearing it. I thought the face would be really big, but its actually a perfect size for my wrist. It lets you answer phone  calls  and read text. You cannot reply to text only read because you have no keyboard, but that's ok for me at least you can read them. You can change it up and customize it anyway you would like through the Zepp app. There are a lot of free apps and custom watch faces on the app that you can download for free. The health features are all great ,Heart rate , o2 stats and the exercise apps are all really good and keep track of multiple types of exercise like walking, running, and bike riding. All the health functions sync really well with my I-Phone.  The sleep app is really nice .You can keep track of your sleeping habits. It lets you see how long and how well you slept through out the night.  The charger charges the phone quickly and you can use it for 8-10 days depending on what apps you are running in the background.  You have to download the Zepp app to use the watch but its really not that hard and the app is very good. Its really easy to set up with the set up QR code. It comes packaged in a nice box with the charger and the user manual.  The charger  works very nice but the cord is a little short Its magnetic and it will only connect it the correct way every time. I have an apple phone and it syncs very easily to it with no issue and the Zepp app is in the apple App store. There is an Alexa link up on there so you can use your Alexa but I am not an Alexa guy so I don't really use it ,but who knows I might in the future at least its there.  All in all I say this is a great watch with a lot of very useful apps and functions. If you want a budget watch with all the high end function of an expensive watch this is for you. I really enjoy the functionality and the ease of use.  5 stars all the way. Signed-- Just A Normal Guy.Read more by Don B., This is a value packed watch!  It is waterproof.  It doesn't have a swimming app, but does a motor boating app, so you can track your boat trip...but that doesn't count as exercise.  Especially if I can cruise around the lake on my pontoon...drinking beer.  Oh...it does have a fishing app!  The GPS tracking is spot on...within a few feet.  The tracking is actually done on your watch...then sent to the phone.  I verified this by walking without my phone.  Not sure you could use it if you were hiking and got lost ...unless you have your phone with you to actually show the route.  The watch shows steps ( which is very accurate because I counted my steps over a .3 mile walk), distance, ave speed , duration, heart rate, and calories.  Battery life seems great.  I have used this for everything in notifications, and phone calls.  Had it for 4 days, and it's still at 64 percent.  I find that the sedentary reminders are a pain in the butt, so I shut them off.  I don't need to be reminded to stand up or walk when I am watching tv. The app is great...once you figure out how to navigate it.  There is sooo much on it, and it took me about 4 hrs working with it, and customizing it to suit my needs.  The watch faces are great.  There are a lot of free ones.  Even one that lets you use your own picture in the background.  The phone sound quality is really good.  I got this watch because my last one...when set to use the watch for phone calls...would send all of the phone audio to the watch.  I get that for music, but not for watching videos on my phone, so that had to go.  This one keeps the sound on my phone for videos.  You can set notifications on the watch to every app on your phone if you need to.  I have all of my cameras, messenger, and sms apps on it for now.  It is really nice that you can see what is going on with your phone in your pocket.  A must when I am driving.  You can type, and save, any quick reply text message you want, so you just select it on the watch, and it sends it.  Really safe...especially if your phone can't connect to your car.  This absolutely the best bang for your buck.  Just take your time to learn the app to set it up, and it will take care of you.  The instructions that come with it are pretty useless.  But then again...if you navigate the app or the watch yourself, you will learn more quickly than trying to read the small print on the paper anyway.Read more by pedalyurassoff, love that it does everything a gps watch does, without an outrageous price tag! i found the GPS to be accurate compared to Strava (pretty sure that uses the phone's GPS though lol). so i guess its pretty accurate compared to my phone's GPS. also like that it tells me how much and the quality of my sleep. though I wish it could detect when I go back to sleep after being awake for a while. also wish it was a darker pink than a baby pink, but thats a minor detail. battery also lasts around a week, maybe even more depending on GPS use. love it!Read more by Izzia Caperina, Es justo lo que esperabaRead more by Mar, La verdad es que tengo apenas una semana con este artículo y me parece que sí está cumpliendo con lo descrito a la hora de hacer la compra.

Brand: Fossil Copeland Men's Watch with Slim Case and Genuine Leather Band, Model: Fossil Copeland Men's Watch with Slim Case and Genuine Leather Band, Price: 56, Material: Stainless Steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Bought on sale approaching Christmas 2022 at 50% off for $48.SIZE: The watch case is 42mm which might not fit SM/MED wrists. See my photos for fitment on a XL hand with normal wrists.STYLE: I bought the 'Brown' model which has a very nice dark coffee brown band with a goldish-tan face, black digits and luminescent hands. I liked what I saw in the sales post, but think this watch would make a wonderful gift for any occasion. The contour of the face is eye-catching without being too much. I tested the luminescence and found I could identify time well enough. Case height is average. I do plan on adding a glass face protector to go on top to protect the original glass. This watch is 5 ATM so can withstand water pressure up to a depth of 50 meters before it suffers water damage. Personally, I wouldn't purposefully swim with a 5 ATM with a leather band, but it's comforting to know this watch is okay swimming for short periods of time or even worn in the shower and rain.PACKAGING: Amazon shipped this in a bubble envelope which adequately protected the standard, and squarish, FOSSIL tin container with teal and orange accents; the same tin shown in the sales ad photos. If your watch came in anything different then Once opened, the watch itself was in a protective plastic sheath, and the watch face has a plastic layer on both the front and back.Overall, I'm very happy with the watch both in the stout packaging, and its quality and appearance. I generally wear higher end watches but the appearance and minimalist design of this one caught my eye. It's the perfect watch for casual to casual-dress attire, and was an easy add to my collection at a very affordable sale price.Read more by JT, Everything, appearance, accuracy of the watch movements and price. well, worth the money.Read more by Jon neal, This watch looks very nice on my husband.

No doubt a watch snob would pooh-pooh it, but I find it enjoyable to ear.Read more by Amazon Customer, The watch itself looks great! It's much lighter than I anticipated but it's still very well made and everything functions properly.The giftbox I received was pretty banged up. Lots of scratches/dents and overall just cheap junk. But easily replaceable by buying a different watch case, which I will be doing.Included inside the giftbox is a registration card. Typically, I wouldn't take the time to do so, but I was slightly skeptical of the watch being genuine and wanted verification of authenticity. The registration process was super simple and took about 2 minutes and the actually checked out to be a REAL Fossil watch.Even with the rinky-dink box, I would totally recommend buying this watch and I'm looking forward to my fiancé s reaction on Christmas!Read more by itmeMagic.

Highly recommended!Read more by MS3, One of my favorite watches! I like the simple design and it is fairly cheap. I have smaller wrists and 38MM fits perfectly. Haven't noticed any time drift on it. The only thing I could see being a negative is that it is fairly loud.Read more by Lance, I've had this watch for more than 5 years now and I have nothing but good things to say about it. I got it as a weekend/outdoors counterpart to my Timex Easy Readers that I wore to the office for more than a decade (one for brown belts, one for black belts). During Covid and WFH, it's even more literally my daily wearer. My Weekender has for years stood up to everything I've thrown at it, worked perfectly, and gotten me several compliments. It's easy to read and has a subtle elegance. At 38mm--not too big, but not small either--the size is perfect to serve you in the outdoors and also augment a subtle style or aesthetic on a night out.I don't like to swim, much less dive. So all I look for in a watch, in terms of WR, is whether it can survive me getting caught in a summer shower, get dishwater splashed on it, or, worst case scenario, a quick splash in the pool or ocean. I haven't swam in this watch, but I've certainly done the first 2 on those list with it. The case held up just fine, no fogging or worse, and wearing a fabric strap means it won't get funky--and you can just throw it in the wash anyway.Despite not swimming in it, I do "sport" in this watch otherwise--jogging, mountain biking, softball, etc. In all those situations, the watch was fine. No signs of slowing down, no cracks or scratches. The indiglo backlight flickers, but I have hardly used that since I was a teenager anyway. The quartz movement means you'll never have to set the watch like a manual needs daily, and like an automatic or solar may require. I've never replaced the battery on my Weekender or had to reset the time because it was off.After a day of sporting, you can toss the sweaty strap in the laundry and pick out a new one based on your outfit, all in a couple seconds. My Weekender was my introduction to NATO and other single-pass fabric straps, and they're now my go-to daily watch set-up.I've never replaced the battery and haven't noticed any lost or gained time. I should mention that I don't really adhere to the mentality that you need to measure how accurate a watch is over a year or more to judge its merits. This watch doesn't have a date window, which would mean several more resets per year, but between traveling between time zones and DST, I have to reset the Weekender several times a year anyway.I wouldn't wear this watch with a dressy outfit, but for everything up to that point, it looks appropriate. I don't like flashy watches or to walk into a room and have my timepiece be the first thing people notice, so this is perfect for me. You should never pick out a watch based on what you think watch snobs will think/say, but if you're worried about it looking 'cheap,' I've only gotten compliments about the Weekender. Like many affordable product lines, there is a surprising fandom out there for this watch. At this price point, I don't think anyone would regret buying it, and its versatility means it may become that go-to watch for when none of the rest make sense. And if it's your only watch--good choice.Read more by Count Mondego, This is a handsome watch. The numbers are large and visible, the ticking is not too loud, there is a backlight button, and it goes with everything. The only downside is the strap, which feels a bit flimsy and cheap. I’ve actually already got a small tear on it despite doing nothing strenuous in it.Read more by Dawson Cumberland, I needed a watch for everyday use in the country, where I might do anything from housework to running errands in town to barn work or dog training in 100 degree heat. It needs to be highly visible night or day without having to put on my glasses, keep good time, be low profile enough not to catch on things or get scratched up, and it's great if it looks good too. This watch does all that very well. The soft wide nylon band is more comfortable than my metal bands or leather ones, especially if I'm doing hot sweaty work.I got the greenish nylon band, and is is not nearly as green as the photo shows. It is definitely olive drab, an army greenish tan. Goes with everything. Looks very tactical, if you're into that.To sum up, I'm ordering a second one, and my husband wants one too!Read more by Rebecca Neef.
Brand: Citizen Promaster Dive Eco-Drive Watch, 3-Hand Date, ISO Certified, Luminous Hands and Markers, Rotating Bezel, Blue/Stainless (Model: BN0151-09L), Model: Citizen Promaster Dive Eco-Drive Watch, 3-Hand Date, ISO Certified, Luminous Hands and Markers, Rotating Bezel, Blue/Stainless (Model: BN0151-09L), Price: 199, Material: Stainless-steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: It has been a tradition for the last few cruises that I buy a watch onboard.  This time I would have, and this was the watch I planned to buy, but they didn't have it in blue, so I abstained on the ship, and ordered this one the day I got home.So why this one?  A couple of reasons.1.) It just has that classic diver look to it.2.) A friend of mine has this watch, and EVERY time I see it when we hang out, it catches my eye.  He abuses his, and years later it still looks great, which is a testament to its durability.3.) Feature packed.Ok - so let's talk about the features.1.) Eco Drive - this is a time-tested technology, and I have several Citizen Eco Drive watches, to include a 1st Gen Eco Drive purchased in 1996 that STILL takes a charge and runs when I get it out.2.) Mineral glass window - not the scratch resistance of sapphire, but TOUGH.3.) Accurate movement.  Prior to DST, I set the watch about 3 weeks prior and it had gained a grand total of 2 seconds.  That's about +3 seconds a month.  You can't find an automatic that will do that.4.) Water resistance to 200 meters with a screw-down crown.5.) Hacking movement - when you pull the stem to the 2nd click, the second hand stops, and that allows you to sync it to the exact second to another time source.-- Side note on movement.  I considered getting the version of this watch with the automatic/self-winding movement, but the movement in that watch is the Miyota 8204, which is a 21.6k movement (rather than 28.8k) that only has an accuracy guarantee of +/- 20 seconds/day.  I have other automatics that are considerably more accurate than thatBottom line - this watch looks great, and it's built to last.  I know I'll get a lot of years of use out of this timepiece.I've included two pics of this watch.  One with the stock blue rubber diver's strap, and another with an aftermarket bracelet that is specifically fitted for this watch case.  I'd name it here but I think that would invalidate the review.  In any case, it's pretty easy to find if you prefer that aesthetic, and it isn't terribly expensive - the stainless bracelet is well worth the investment and it gives the option of either aesthetic.Read more by Patrick Gleason, Overall, one of the best pieces of work gear I have ever invested in, for my line of work.I am a swimming pool technician, a pool guy, and have been for the last 10 years of my life. I work for one of the largest pool maintenance companies in SoCal and am now a Route Manager, overseeing over 800 individual pools.My everyday has and still consists of many different jobs.Cleaning swimming pools, where I am CONSTANTLY submerging my hands in chlorinated and salinated (salt) water, which does have a corrosive and/or oxidative effect on certain metals.Interacting hands-on with different corrosive and oxidizing chemicals, all of which gets on my hands and wrists at some point everyday.Maintaining, cleaning, and repairing various pumps, filters, plumbing, heaters, automation/electrical pool systems, and valves. This frequently places my hands in uncomfortable, tight spaces where I will bang, scrape, and smash my watches against concrete, metal, and other hard materials in the equipment areas I am working in.I have worn this watch every weekday for the last 5 years for this job. I replaced the original rubberized strap for a nylon/cotton blend NATO strap so it would dry quickly and breathe better. The watch face paint has stood up very well considering how rough my job is on it, with what would be considered as understandable wear and tear. And in my opinion, it gives a worked-in quality of character to the watch.The crystal itself has a few MINOR scratches, which I’m surprised hasn’t cracked or been marred even further, given that I have truly had it banged around hard in my line of work. None of these scratches affect the readability of the watch face at all. You actually have to look in an angled reflection to notice them.The lume of the glowing hands and digits are still VERY strong and last a pretty dang long time. I’m in the sun all day long and so the glow lume gets charged like crazy all day, then lasts for hours into the night.I can also say with certainty that I have NEVER had a battery issue, being that it’s an Eco-Drive and it gets a full belly of sun every working day, I’m not surprised at all. I don’t know when it will ever need a power cell replacement, but it's probably going to be a WHILE being that my line of work puts it in a recharging state at all times.Lastly, the steel body of the watch itself is as solid as when it arrived. It does have some scratch marks, but no gouges. And just in the last 6 months or so, a very light showing of rust-colored oxidization has been showing on the inside of the bezels. I’m surprised its taken THIS long to finally show some signs of oxidizing with how often its been scratched and banged, then plunged into salt and chlorine water and exposed to various chemicals.Overall, I am very pleased with the performance and durability of this watch. In a job where I quickly go through footwear, shorts/pants, sunglasses, hats, multitools/knives/handtools, and other pieces of gear, this watch has stood out as the most rugged and long lasting piece of gear I have bought for my job. I have no doubt it will last a further 5 years easily in the exact same conditions, especially if I give a light polishing for any oxidized areas (which I still haven’t yet).Highly recommend this watch for someone looking for a durable timepiece that can take a beating and still look classy and handsome. I also highly recommend switching to a NATO strap for an even more secure retention (watch won't fall off your wrist if one of the strap bars breaks or pops out).Read more by Eric, I previously had purchased the black version of this watch because I felt the black would go better overall with my normal casual wear.  But I liked that one so much that I decided to get this blue version also.  To my surprise, it actually goes better with my clothes than the black one does.  It can be worn for casual or dress.I love the location of the crown because it does not dig into my wrist.  The size is perfect and the colors are dark blue and not overwhelming.  I have to check twice sometimes to distinguish between the black and the blue.  The face is easy to read, but I  agree with some others who in their reviews were mildly critical of the date window.  It is recessed and small and is sometimes a struggle to read.  I have found that turning towards a light source usually solves the problem.  The illumination is fine as far as my needs are concerned.  The band is sporty and comfortable.  The bezel only turns in one direction, but is tight and precise. These two watches are my 4th and 5th Eco Drives.  They keep perfect time and you just have to wear them outside or put them on a window sill once in awhile.  Overall a fun watch with excellent quality and value.Like I said earlier, I liked the first one (black) enough to buy the second (blue) and I am happy with both.  They are fun to wear and add diversion to my modest watch collection.Read more by T. F.M., This watch is a great daily time piece.The Eco-Drive Solar Quartz movement is durable, accurate and does not require battery changes for an extended period of time with many users stating the watch has operated smoothly for more than 10 years. The case design feels extremely robust and is backed up by ISO Certified 200m water resistance. To further add to this, it also includes a screw down crown for more security. The lume is extremely good and the watch also features a date window. Lastly, I confidently chose this time piece as my daily due to Citizen's excellent warranty as well as the service center being only 45 mins from my home.When it comes to appearances, I personally enjoy the look of this time piece and have very little to complain about. This piece also comes in a multitude of colours and you will definitely find one that you would enjoy wearing on your wrist!Since this is a quartz watch, due note that there are times when the second's hands to not line up the the markings inside the dial. Mine did not have this issue but it is something to note! I did however run into this issue with my Citizen BM8180-03E which I also purchased on Amazon and this is where Citizen's warranty and service center location adds great value to this time piece.I dropped off my timepiece at their service center and filled out a short form for personal information. I received email confirmation of them accepting my time piece and after 4 weeks, I received my watch back with properly lined up seconds hand!Overall the only downsides I can think of is the strap. It definitely feels a bit stiff when you first get it but there are tricks you can find online such as using warm water and a cup to help form it to fit your wrist better!***Note***This Amazon sold model does not come with the strap that has the text for non decompression times and did not come in the traditional scuba bottle box.Read more by Tommy, Tengo muchos relojes automáticos pero andaba buscando uno de quarzo. Tenia un reloj Orient muy parecido a este similar al Mako 2. Compre este para ver si lo podía suplir. En calidad supero al Orient un 100%. Lo único que no me agrado es el bezel que es de 60 clicks y no se siente como los del seiko, pero te aseguro que no es malo solo no se siente como un Seiko. El dial es de excelente calidad mejor que los skx007/009 . Las manecillas excelente. El Lume súper brillante y en dos tonos. El brillo del dial es azul y el brillo del bezel es verde me gusto ese detalle de dos colores. Los acabados del case son excelentes. Otra cosa que no me agrado es que la tapa requiere una llave especial para cambiar la batería, aun que este reloj tiene una batería recargable así que no creo que sea problema en unos años resalto que esto por que rara vez dejo que le metan mano a mis relojes por lo general y mientras se pueda yo los reparo y les doy servicio. Calculo que la vida de la batería seria unos 6 años por experiencia. La fecha me gusto el lugar y el tamaño aun que para una persona que utilice lentes pueda ser algo chico. Por ultimo lo compre en oferta y es lo que mas me gusto.19/Jun/2018Se puede abrir la tapa trasera con llave de 2 pines aun que me decepciono ver la maquina tan pequeña que lleva dentro. Espero sea duradera. Hasta ahorita el reloj sin problemas. Queria un reloj de quarzo aunque soy mas de automático pero siempre se requieren algunos de quarzo.Read more by Amazon Customer.
Brand: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 43mm Watch – Black Dial & Case with Brown Leather Strap, Model: Timex Men's Expedition Scout 43mm Watch – Black Dial & Case with Brown Leather Strap, Price: 35, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: I'll admit I'm a watch fanatic and have WAY more watches than I should.  I'm very protective of most of them, but my collection includes a couple of "beaters" - watches that I don't mind putting in harm's way out in the yard or in the garage.  That category already had a 40mm version of the Timex Expedition quartz, which filled the bill nicely, but the deal on this newer model was such that I couldn't pass it up.  And, as the title suggests, it's actually quite good.  At 43mm it's a little larger than I prefer on my 7.5" wrist, but again it's a beater not a fashion statement.  It wears comfortably, comes with a decent leather strap, and has excellent legibility.  Although comfortable, I don't expect the strap to stand up to much abuse.  But, with 20mm lugs, it won't be hard to replace.  The case has good heft to it and is finished in a flat black.  It has a very "ruggedly casual" vibe to it.The caseback is the press-on type.  Water resistance is claimed at 50m, which means you'll probably be okay walking in the rain or washing your hands while wearing it, but that's about it.  If you change your own batteries it will take a CR2016 when the time comes.  Accuracy is very good, but no points for that as it's to be expected with a quartz.  I was pleased to see the sweep of the second hand matches up with the indices (most of the time), a small thing which can be problematic with some cheaper watches. The red tip on the second hand is a nice touch.  Although it looks like there is lume that has aged to a nice patina, there actually isn't any lume on the hands or dial.  That's okay, this is an Indiglo so a push of the crown lights up the backlighting.  It does require pushing the crown with your free hand, and the light only stays on as long as the crown is depressed.  It would have been a nice feature if the light stayed on for a few seconds after actuation, though.All in all, I'm impressed with this watch.  So much so that I'm pretty sure I'll feel badly the first time I bang the heck out of it in the garage.  Somehow I don't think the watch will care.Read more by D. Baker, Looks good on my wrist.  Not too big, not too small.  The leather band appears to be of good quality and easily replaceable with a 20mm watch band.  I bought this because it does not talk to me, notify me, or alert me to anything.  Only the date appears on the face.  Timex was king for inexpensive, reliable watches when I was a kid.  I know times have changed but I would buy again!Read more by billwunder, I love the Timex Expedition Watch and have loved it since I first received one as a Christmas gift from my In-Laws in 2002 after I became a fire chaplain. They reasoned I would appreciate the IndiGlow feature during fire calls in the dead of night. It was fantastic! Unfortunately, my Timex was damaged beyond repair in 2015. I’ve hinted that I wanted another to relatives ever since. My new Timex Expedition came just recently as I suggested the watch as a better gift than one my spouse had proposed. She came out spending less and I’m thrilled! It looks good, works perfectly, and becomes a new resource for my chaplaincy once again.Read more by Darrell M Coons, Item arrived new and unworn.  As usual  the packaging took a beating during shipping, but watch was fine, so far.  Dial is visible even in low light, because of the black/cream contrast.  You really only need the Indigo light if it's almost pitch black.  The leather band seems to be very nice quality.  I'll be applying a little watered down left over coffee to tone the white stitching to more of a cream/tan to better match the dial.  The hands are not luminous, despite what the item description says.  It's keeping good time so far, and fits my wrist nicely in an unobtrusive way.  Only negatives so far are the erroneous item description, and I wish both of the leather strap retaining loops were moveable.  the one nearest the clasp is sewn in, making it kind of tight to get the strap in their for my big fingers.Read more by DKMcGinnis, Keeps great time and good value. Awesome for those situations where you don't want to wear or risk a more expensive watch. I wear it traveling overseas and for outdoor activities. Durable, dependable and great value.Read more by Coyote Griller.

Brand: Timex Women's Cavatina Watch - TPearl Dial Gold-Tone Case, Model: Timex Women's Cavatina Watch - TPearl Dial Gold-Tone Case, Price: 39, Material: Stainless Steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Disclaimer: I have not personally used this product. I bought it as a present for a woman I've been helping who was physically beaten multiple times over the course of several years by both her ex-boyfriend and her sister. She grew up in an upper middle class family, but now is living penniless (literally) in a domestic abuse shelter. Her story and the psychological damage have been horrifying. I explain this so that readers will know the impact that this watch has had on her.*  *  *In order for me to give anything 5 stars, it has to fulfill several criteria: utility, safety, craftsmanship, and durability. This watch wins on all counts.As someone who grew up with Timex Triathlon watches, I know that these watches are durable. I'd love to see Timex come up with a cool logo to replace the clunky-looking TIMEX that they write on their watches. But few things are perfect.So, the woman I bought this for has a tiny wrist. That's because she is tiny. She's shorter than 5 feet and weighs less than 90 pounds. No, she's not anorexic, she's just very small. And she has the one of the smallest wrists I've ever seen on an adult. So, getting her a watch that doesn't require taking out links or punching holes in the wristband is nearly impossible.Just to give you an idea of the kind of family she grew up in, she was wearing a Tag Heuer watch until a few months ago. Tag Heuer watches are famous and expensive. I priced out her watch and it was easily over $1000. As a reference, I've never owned a watch that costed more than $60.But then she decided to seek justice in the U.S. court system against her highly abusive ex-boyfriend. Her family got frightened because his family is powerful, and they told her that if she continues they will completely cut her off. I didn't think they would actually do this, but they did. For the past year, she has received absolutely no money from them, and even though she has several sisters, none of them have called or even emailed her once since her family cut her off. That is why she has floated in and out of homeless shelters and domestic violence shelters. She wants to see her ex-boyfriend brought to justice.During that time, one guy attempted to kidnap and rape her, and another guy pointed a gun to her head and robbed her. All of this is documented by the police.And these things resulted in her crying in front of me as she gave me her Tag Heuer watch to safekeep for her until her living situation stabilizes. Then she started arriving at many of her appointments late because she no longer had a watch. I'm not talking about meetings with friends because she has no friends since this happened. I'm talking about meetings with the assistant DA's office, abuse counselors, and other people involved in trying to help her through this horrible ordeal.Finally, I decided to buy her a watch. Why? No, I'm not dating her. I'm just trying to show her that America still has decent people. Why is that important? Because she is not from this country, and many Americans were living in her apartment complex and heard her getting beaten for over a year by her ex-boyfriend. And still none of them called the police? So, yes, I feel a sense of duty to show her that not all Americans are selfish. I owe a lot to my parents on this one, because they raised me to help others and stick up for those who are too weak to fight for themselves.I spent a lot of time researching watches because I wanted to give her a watch that would make her feel great and help to rebuild her self-esteem. Translation: I didn't want to give her a cheap watch that reminds her of all the cheap stuff she has to get from donations that people give to her shelter.At the risk of sounding crazy, I spent far too many hours researching women's watches. Because she is so tiny, a round-faced watch doesn't look right on her. Also, her skin is very sensitive as evidenced by the occasional eczema on her neck. I used to see red spots near her watch, and I thought they were bug bites. But she told me that her skin has a reaction to the Tag Heuer metal band.Finally, I found this watch. After reading several of the Amazon reviews, I realized that this was the perfect watch for her. Why?1) the watch is not round-faced. It has a nice oval shape which is great for a small person2) the wristband is the only one I could find (out of the hundreds of watches I researched) that was made for a person with a small wrist. Even on her wrist, when she fastens the watch to her wrist, there are a couple of holes still remaining.3) the wristband is made of calfskin leather. So she has no allergic contact dermatitis reactions on her wrist anymore.4) the watch looks classy5) this watch is made by Timex, and I've never owned a bad Timex watch.6) I'm not rich, so I couldn't go out and spend hundreds of dollars on a watch.Honestly, I was nervous about giving her the watch. Why? Because I was replacing her Tag Heuer $1000+ watch with a watch that costs less than $25. Even though it was a gift, I wanted to give her something that said "quality" as part of her rehabilitation process. I've watched the way that her self-esteem has been eroded by her current living conditions. And it doesn't help that her abuser lives a fantastic life in a wonderful apartment in a great area.Her reaction when I gave it to her? She started crying. She was shocked that it was new. For the past year, she has been living on second-hand clothes and donated food that is often close to or past their expiration dates. Her shelter is in a low-income and dangerous area, so she is constantly looking over her shoulder when she walks to and from it. And her friends who know both her and the ex-boyfriend all avoid her (it's part of her country's culture).She slowly and very carefully took it out of the box as if it were a Rolex. Then she touched the inside of the leather band and was impressed with how smooth it was. When she asked me to touch the inside of the wristband, I was also impressed by its quality. She turned the watch over several times to look at its build quality which she liked, and then she was surprised when she put it on and it fit perfectly. Just before she put it on, she told me, "I'll probably have to punch a couple of holes in it because every watch I've had has a wristband that's too large." So, that made this watch even more special.I will never forget that moment. I guess I could say that it was a "Timex moment". It shows that there are still companies like Timex which build a great watch for a reasonable price. And at the risk of sounding campy, it makes me proud that an American company puts out such great products. And my hope in giving her an American watch is to convince her that the hell she endured for the four years in America while she was beaten by two people very close to her is not what we consider the "American Dream".She has been wearing the watch every day, and she loves it.One other thing worth noting is that Timex makes this watch with a brown wristband. I was thiking about getting that one from Amazon (Model # T2M567), but the hands are gold-colored which makes it hard to see under certain conditions. The hands on this model (T21912) are black which makes them highly visible as other reviewers have commented.Normally, I don't write incredibly long reviews like this. But sometimes an item gains a special life of its own because of the story and circumstances surrounding it.As for this woman, she still lives in a shelter. She still has to subsist on second-hand clothes and food, but at least she has a first-class watch, and when you're rebuilding your life, you have to start from something, don't you?I can't recommend this watch highly enough. I'm not sure that it's the best watch for much bigger women, but if you have a really small wrist, then this is the watch for you.P.S. try to remember at the end of reviews you like to click on the "Yes" button that a good review was helpful. This inspires good reviewers to write more often, and that helps all of us.lthough I'm not so crazy about the Timex logo (they don't have one and just use the standard name of the company on their watches).Read more by JK &#34;keeping it real&#34;, The media could not be loaded.I just got this watch and it fits perfectly! It’s lightweight, the gold coloring is beautiful, it seems to be pretty well made, and it wasn’t too crazy expensive. I’m not sure how water resistant it would be as it doesn’t seem built for intense waterworks… you can’t really adjust it as it’s a stretchy band. The band itself is a little scratchy on the skin so if you get annoyed by a little bit of roughness this isn’t for youRead more by Jen, Perfect for small wrists. Still big on mine but I don’t mind that it moves around. You can always make it smaller.  It’s very beautiful and daintyRead more by Brie, This is a cute watch for those of us with petite wrists.  It’s comfortable and stylish.  The face is a bit smaller than I expected but it’s still easy to read.  Timex has produced quality watches since their beginning, and continue to do so now. I gave it four stars because the gold trim around the face of the watch is very dull looking and doesn’t shine up so I wonder of how it will wear over time.  Good purchase - would recommend.Read more by cblue55, This a beautiful watch.  Dainty and looks great on the wrist.  Love the oval face.  Great price.

Almost a bit too flashy - would have been better with a matte finish on the bezel, face and hour markers to tone it down a bit.  So far, though, I like it.

Didn’t want an expensive watch that I have to take off occasionally for security check points, or leave in hotel rooms while working out or doing outdoor activities, etc.  This one fits the need nicely.Read more by KodiakMan, I purchased this watch as a birthday gift for my uncle.

This is a great work-appropriate office watch with understated timeless elegance and a beautiful leather watch band that will not go out of style. The leather watch band is soft on the underside and doesn't feel ruff when it rubs up against your skin. I know Bulova isn't considered a luxury watch brand, but the feel and look of it are serving understated luxury within a reasonable price, which I really like. The crown is easy to deploy and put back into place, and having an automatic watch is nice because there is no need to replace a battery.Read more by Shawn, Your Friendly Baker, I purchased mine on sale.

Like the title says I wear it everyday. Looks great in any style of clothing. I wear collared shirts and ties for work and basketball shorts and tee shirts on the weekend. Relatively light in weight. Feels good on the wrist. The watch is beautiful. The rose gold notches, hands, and crown resemble a subtle but classy look to the dark gray face plate. Winded it about 30-40 rotations when I opened it. I wear it everyday and it hasn't stopped on me yet. Fantastic watch for the money.Read more by Andrew Phillip Hartnett, Typical Bulova quality.

Brand: Timex Women's Easy Reader Watch, Model: Timex Women's Easy Reader Watch, Price: 34, Material: Brass, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Stylish, simple, yet elegant. Readable numbers, good size (I prefer smart watches).Read more by Elizabeth R., The media could not be loaded.Okay so I used to have a Smartwatch with a silicone band. It was great for all the features,  but the silicone actually burned my skin, and I wanted something low tech. So I needed a watch with a natural material band. This is perfect!I love the size of the band; it's not too big or bulky for my little wrist. I love how dainty it looks, but the leather strap is actually so durable. I love the size of the watch face although if it was smaller face that would be totally fine too, just not bigger. This one is the 25 mm width one.The brown leather and gold is just the perfect classic elegant combo and goes well with casual or dressy clothes. I love the display that has the little date stamp on it. You just push the button in to see the glowy face at night.The button has 4 settings: OUT (change the time). MIDDLE (change the date clockwise) IN/NORMAL (the time and date tick normally), and Pressed IN (the glow light on the face turns on for as long as the button is pushed).Idk if anyone else does this, but sometimes I don't actually want a watch on my wrist,  and dont have pockets, but still want the time on me. So I put my watch on my ankle 😆😆 I actually did that on my wedding day,  and I have a photo of me lifting up my dress and checking the time on my ankle 😆. I'm telling you,  it's an amazing life hack.Anyways! This is the perfect watch.  I don't have any improvements to say. It's so amazing.Read more by Connie, Looking for a practical watch? This is it. I like the night light. Will see how long it lasts. Date window is tiny but can be seen. I didn’t buy the watch for the date window; have a smart phone. I have a small wrist and the band could be smaller. It’s the standard size. The band; well, it leaves a bit to be desired. It feels like plastic; stiff. Far from leather. For the price it works. 25 mm isn’t too big. I would prefer a smaller diameter clock size & still be round. Easy to set date.Read more by Jo Ann, I like the watch.  As expected, easy to read, with the much-appreciated Indigo light. 5* on the watch.  Black leather band is a little stiff but works just fine.However, I clearly got an old battery.  Watch was received in late May; battery died in early July, luckily NOT while I was.out of town.  Now I have to get a replacement battery (unexpected cost) & fight my way into the watch to replace the battery.  Inconvenient.Read more by Sarah, This is a fine watch with a clear dial and a nice leather strap. The numbers are easy to read even for someone whose eyesight is not very good.Read more by Aoushment.
Brand: Casio Men's Quartz Day-Date Indicator Black Resin Dive Watch (Model: MRW200H-1BV), Model: Casio Men's Quartz Day-Date Indicator Black Resin Dive Watch (Model: MRW200H-1BV), Price: 21, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Great watch for the price. Usable bezel for timing events, 100m water resist, light weight, day/ date, decent lume with a charge from a light.....and it's very accurate. Need a watch under $20? Even under $50,  this is a good choice. Great travel watch. You don't need more.Update 2/19I have beaten on this watch like a red headed geek.....given it zero respect, with no regard to its well being....and it hasnt skipped a beat...its very accurate , loses a couple seconds a week maybe. For this price and to get this tactical cool look....its literally a zero brain proposition. It has a plastic crystal - making it uber light weight, but takes some scratches - so what?. I have pounded this thing doing chores, laundry, dishes, showers, grocery shopping, dog walking - all of the daily tactical things one does in the crazed world we live in. For the price, if you like understated simplicity and value for cash, this is it. When I do step out, and forget I have it on, I dont feel under watched, I still feel as if people will look at it and think it looks cool, masculine, even a little tactically sexy. The bezel is always being used to time things - from cooking, to whatever you need to keep track of.....you can use a dive type bezel is various ways - by minutes, or use it as an hourly reminder - say you want to remember when you last did something say, 1:30pm, just stick the red triangle at the mid point between 1 and 2, so you know it was 1:30 you did that item..etc, you get the idea....so for $15 bucks or so...you get that utility, in an accurate watch, that is durable, looks cool, has Day and Date, and some lume, just enough lume to work with....really, these watches are ideal for this money. You can really thump hard on this little red headed geek, but its always going to be your friend. Oh, and the other thing its great for - a tactical "sleeping" watch.....you dont want to have a bulky or heavy watch on at night....but you should have one - because you never know whats going to happen in the middle of the night - you dont even pay attention to this thing....its pretty much weightless....just charge the lume with a light or flashlight before bed, you will be able to see it well enough at 3am in pitch dark if needed. Forget a G Shock as a beater, why spend the money? $15 bucks, get a couple to just plop in your different vehicles or desk at work etc....reset them every 2 or 3 months and you are always good to go on the timepiece. Zero Brainer purchase. Hey, even if I was stepping into a field of battle - I would be ok with having this watch go with me as a primary timepiece.....take out your frustrations on the MRW-200h, it thrives on the abuse.Read more by chris, This watch is everything you need in a daily watch. Its legible, comfortable to wear, accurate, tough, what else could you want for such a low price ? Highly recommended.Read more by Sarah Makai, This watch was only 25 bucks. I really like the look of it. Simple and elegant. It does all the basics: hour, minute and second hand, date and day of the week, and it has a movable bezel like dive watches. And it's water resistant up to 10 bars, or 333 feet. That's pretty amazing for twenty-five bucks. I've paid ten times that amount for watches that do no more than this one. The black is very attractive. I replaced the chintzy-looking rubber strap with a good looking black leather strap.  I don't know how long this watch will last, but I've had Casios that lasted ten years. I had another one like that that a friend gave me but it quit working, and the 25 bucks for a new one is less than a horologist would charge to fix the old one.Read more by Guthrie McIllhennon, I was looking for an inexpensive, large-face analog watch that I could use for travel when I wanted to leave my more expensive watches safely at home.  This large face Casio was the perfect solution.  The watch face is indeed large - about the same size as my 45mm Apple iWatch9 (see photo). The large face is easy to read; the 24 hour numbering is convenient for overseas travel where time is often referenced on a 24 hour clock (for example: 2:00 pm = 14:00).  Priced at about $22 (as of 27 Aug 2024) this watch is also a great value.  RECOMMENDED.Read more by C. Green, Great casual and outdoors watch, nice look, very durable.Read more by James F..

Packaging and overall item came in perfectly. Works great. Looks great and will work well with causal wear as well as formal wear. The price was right at 45% off at the time I purchased it. I almost bought the black and blue one, but my husband has enough watches lol.Read more by Kristina G., This watch looks fantastic—both sporty and elegant at the same time. I bought the black one, and I love the blue crystal face. I have small wrists, and it fits perfectly—not too large and not too small. I'm on the fifth hole of the band, which is right in the middle, so if you have large wrists, it might be too small for you. The leather is very thick, so it took a few days to break in, but hopefully it will last for a long time time.Now the negatives: the face is impossible to see in the dark. The hands are supposed to glow, but they don't. Even when I charge them with a light they only glow for about 30 seconds. Why Fossil doesn't use a material that truly glows in the dark I have no idea. How expensive can that material be? Also, the chronograph is totally useless. The first time I tried to use it, one of the hands wouldn't zero out. I have no plans to use it, so it's not that big of a deal, but I wish I'd never tried it because I'm kinda OCD, and the fact that the hands didn't go back to the top is gonna bug me a little bit.Other than that, I love this watch. My last Fossil lasted 20 years, so I really hope this one will last as long.Read more by Aladinsane1969.

It pairs with your phone and you can see and control some features from the phone app too.Battery life is great - probably going to last 4-5 days on full charge with regular use.Read more by Nick.
Brand: Anne Klein Women's Leather Strap Watch, Model: Anne Klein Women's Leather Strap Watch, Price: 24, Material: Metal, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: My mom has been on a hunt for a wrist watch but she is very picky about how they look and the style. It’s been nearly impossible to find what she likes. I have these a try and ordered them for Mother’s Day. She absolutely LOVED them! I got the brown leather ones and they look so nice on her wrist. They are the perfect size and she already received so many compliments. They are not heavy, comfortable to wear, and look a lot more expensive than what they were. She now wants a different one with a different strap. Extra daughter points for men Highly recommend!Read more by KT, I've been using this watch daily for work for almost a full year now without any issues! the leather hasn't worn, the watch still works accurately, and the size is perfect for my smaller wrists.

I've gotten many compliments for this watch, highly recommend!Read more by Haley, This is probably my 7th women’s Anne Klein watch purchase. It’s stylish and affordable. Great quality for the price point. Soft slim band. I purchased the cream/gold so I can pair with any outfit where I wear gold accessories. It has a creamy mother of pearl looking face. I might purchase this style in other colors, I love it so much. I can’t speak on how long the band lasts or battery life as I just received it, however I will say my oldest Anne Klein watch is 4 years old and still ticking in good condition.Read more by Leena Yun, I love this watch, and I’ve gotten compliments on how it looks. I also love that, even though I don’t normally, I can wear it in water like a quick shower or swimming. The one downside is the two little “leather” straps that hold the buckle part down (not sure the right term for it—see picture) broke within a couple months of wearing it. So now the excess just kind of hangs off and gets caught in my hair or on things. But I still wear it. Because overall I still like the watch. It works well and I like that they had already set the time to my time zone so I didn’t have to set it when I got it 😅 so that was nice. Anyway, I wanted a feminine watch and I feel this one is attractively so.Read more by Heidi Smith, I love the style of this watch and the price was amazing! My mother loved it!

Reviews: My Galaxy (4) watch was ready for an upgrade!I always do my research and read the reviews before I buy a product. This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!Read more by marlene, The SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch is an exceptional device that combines durability, advanced technology, and AI-powered features for both everyday use and fitness tracking. Its bold 47mm case, bright AMOLED display, and waterproof design make it suitable for rugged environments, while the LTE connectivity allows for phone-free communication, making it perfect for outdoor activities. The AI-driven health monitoring system tracks heart rate, blood oxygen levels, stress, and sleep patterns, with an added body composition sensor for detailed fitness insights. With Samsung's advanced chipset, the watch offers smooth performance and up to 3 days of battery life. It excels in fitness tracking with precise metrics for running, swimming, hiking, and cycling, and its customization options via Tizen OS add versatility. Though the size may be large for smaller wrists and the app ecosystem is more limited compared to WearOS, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is ideal for fitness enthusiasts and outdoor adventurers seeking a reliable, intelligent smartwatch.Read more by M., I'm liking it so far, I can respond to my WhatsApp messages from the watch if you like voice to text its good enough I haven't had problems with it, you can also type by hand writing or keyboard, I can also control my Spotify music and choose Playlist or artists the screen is very responsive I haven't had problems with it not detecting my fingertips even with gloves, my favorite feature so far is the health monitor that's always active showing me my heart rate during the day and tracking my sleep showing me how much I slept, how long and the different stages of my sleep, you can also download more apps and I downloaded 2044 for when I just need a small game to distract my brain, with all those features and more this watch battery doesn't last a whole day it may last about 16 hours more or less depending on how you use it if you don't want the health tracking if probably can last longer, the watchband I didnt like I bought an after market one and now It looks more casual.Read more by David, It does everything as advertised well. I went with this model rather than the plus because it was lighter and less bulky.Read more by JHC, I upgraded from 4 to 7 and I can see the difference!Battery life is a little worse but will last you a day. Also charges super fast. I put it to charge while I shower and that is more than enough.All the trackers on it are better and give me more data. And the green color is a nice change for the always boring smart watches.Read more by Jay.
Brand: Casio Men's Classic Japanese-Quartz Watch with Resin Strap, Black, 21 (Model: AE1200WH-1A), Model: Casio Men's Classic Japanese-Quartz Watch with Resin Strap, Black, 21 (Model: AE1200WH-1A), Price: 19, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Last updated: 7 Aug. 2019, 3 yrs. 9 months after original purchase.I purchased this watch Nov 2015, and the band broke June 2017. The band lasted just over 1.5 years. Note that I wore it 24/7 the *entire* 1.5 years! I literally only took it off to switch wrists probably 4 times over that period. It was on all day, all night, in the shower, in the pool, at the beach, in sports, etc etc you get the point.  I love this watch because it is super cheap (~$15) yet it has multiple alarms and a countdown timer instead of just a stopwatch timer. It's basically a G-shock quality watch for $15 instead of $45.When the band did break, it broke very suddenly! I didn't see any cracks on it or anything, but I literally rubbed my wrist across an object while turning and the band tore in two and the whole watch fell right off my wrist. Upon closer inspection, I saw cracks all along the inside of the band against my wrist, and if I bent the band hard it would break in other locations too.So, replaced the band with a nice durable nylon nato strap! I used this one (Replacement 18mm nato strap nylon watch band - Black, 5 ring Black PVD Buckle). It cost me < $10 and is an excellent watch strap! It (luckily) came with 2 pcs 18mm x 1.4mm spring bars instead of 18mm x 1.8mm diameter spring bars, which would have been too thick for this watch since there is so little space between the bars and the watch. This Casio watch comes originally with 2 pcs 18mm x 1.8mm diam spring bars, which are too thick when used with this nato strap.For the 18mm x 1.4mm bars, with a little work and a flathead screwdriver used to press the bar down hard against the strap (first to make an indentation in the band, with the bar not placed yet, and 2nd to press the bar into place), I was able to make this strap with the 1.4mm diam bars fit this watch!If you want to use a nato strap, expect it to be a very tight fit, and MAKE SURE TO GET A STRAP THAT IS 1.4~1.5mm thick max, and spring bars that are 18mm x 1.3~1.5mm MAX DIAMETER, *NOT* 1.8mm diameter. Otherwise it will be impossible to make it fit I think. I also used a spring bar tool (Ritche Professional 360pc Watch Band Stainless Steel Link Pins,spring Bars+remover Repair Tool (8-25mm)), which helped remove the old bars and situate the new bars, and I used a large flathead screwdriver with quite a bit of pressure to press the spring bar into place, indenting it against the watch, once the band was in place.Awesome watch! Awesome 18mm nato strap I've linked to above! Great combo together! I expect this combo to last me many more years than the original resin strap did.Update 7 Aug. 2019:I've had the watch now for 3.75 years. I've worn it 24/7 during this entire time: all day, all night, in the shower every day for nearly 4 years, while exercising, etc. I've only taken it off about a dozen times to switch wrists is all. I've had the 18mm nato strap on it for > 2 years (from June 2017 to today, Aug 2019).  Somewhere around 10 months to a year ago, one of the the spring bars broke out of the plastic hole on the watch due to excessive pressure since the nato strap was such a tight fit. So, I simply drilled 2 tiny holes in the watch and ran some 50 lb fishing line through and tied it off. Problem solved! That lasted about another year until the watch got water inside it just last week while swimming. I wonder if it was due to those holes I drilled somehow letting water in. I should have drilled sideways through the plastic tabs in the same holes where the spring bar used to connect instead of drilling down through the side of the plastic case like I did. Lesson learned: I'll do that next time.Anyway, time for another watch. Buying this same one would be a good buy.My only complaints about this watch are:1. It's bigger than preferred (I'd prefer a women's size watch honestly due to carpal tunnel wrist pain caused by doing pushups for decades and typing all day--the larger mens watches like this jam up into my wrist while doing pushups and exacerbate the situation)2. The time zone gets changed randomly sometimes while exercising or doing pushups, since a button accidentally gets pressed.3. The countdown timer has second-resolution (yaaay!, that's good!) but does *not* have the auto-repeat feature the G-Shock I had years ago had, which means I have to manually restart the watch after each countdown. I liked having the option to make it auto-restart the countdown when doing things like running laps or doing repetitive drills where I want to switch the activity every X seconds or minutes.That's all, folks. It's a good watch at a good price. 4 years 24/7 is highly respectable. And the nato strap? It's still in great shape. Good for another 6 years or so I bet (10 years total).Read more by Gabriel S, This is my favorite Casio watch I think. Even with my small collection of G-Shocks, and a few other Casio models, this is my favorite. This watch is my go to at home functional watch and my watch when I need to be really mindful of the time when I am out.Functions:Excellent backlight for Casio. Casio usually has ok backlights (Never quite as good as Timex), but the low end casio watches are usually lacking...not this one. It has a good backlight that lasts for a second or two when pressed that illuminates the entire time readout. This is a huge win for me as I use a light frequently to check a watch at night and in the early morning.Timer and Stopwatch: These are both on the watch and easy to use. They are effective at what they do and the alarms are load enough to hear them with mild ambient sound. Maybe not so much in a super loud environment, but normally I do not think this would be an issue.World Time: Also very easy to figure out and has an awesome map. I split my time between London and Los Angeles as we have our International office located in the UK and I like to readily know what time it is for my team out there. I also love the map, it makes it easy to tell when you are approaching the right timezone so you don't always blow passed it when searching for your own. Not to mention I just enjoy the aesthetics.Size and Style: This watch is very light for being pretty big. It is true to size and does not wear much bigger that it seems. I have small rests, but it feels comfortable and looks good. It does have some retro styling, this watch has not changed in a long time, and I feel that is a strong positive for it. It looks good. I have both this version and the round one, and this one is way better. The pushers on the round one are not metal. I took the band off and paired it with a Barton Brand green canvas 18mm band and it looks real nice.Some people mod these a little, or at least remove the wording on the case. I left mine alone, and will probably not attempt to mod it. The strap it comes with is comfortable enough, but cheap, so I would recommend another 18mm band. The Barton Brand 18mm quick fitting buckle band looked really good on this.So, for the price of the watch and maybe another 15 bucks, you can get an excellent all around watch that has functionality to perform tons of jobs around the house and even in travels for less than $50. I plan on using this whenever I am abroad for its ease of use, durability, and cost if it is broken or stolen. And yes the watch has good water resistance and has stood up through washing dishes, showers, getting knocked around during yard work, etc. Yes, it will pick up scratches, but the case and plastic crystal hold up pretty well for all of that.I highly recommend this watch.Read more by RyanT2, The Casio AE-1200 is an amazing watch at an incredibly affordable price. It boasts a stylish, retro design with a durable build that feels comfortable on the wrist. The world time function, multiple alarms, LED backlight, and impressive 10-year battery life offer exceptional value. Water resistance up to 50 meters adds to its versatility. Highly recommend this watch for its functionality and affordability. Excellent seller with fast shipping and great service!Read more by Anton, When Amazon asks if this watch is giftable, comfortable, or quality material it gets 3 stars across the board. However, when it comes to an overall rating I give this watch a resounding 5 stars. Why? Two words; functional, value.This watch does multiple timezones exceptionally well, allowing you to select 4 timezones to switch between with the push of a button, without relying on wifi/LTE which can be tough to come by consistently in international travel. The map is useful as well, darkening the countries/states that correspond with your current timezones setting, helping to ground you as to where you are on your travels. Being able to switch timezones so easily helps immensely with understanding timing for connecting flights, greatly reducing travel stress. All of this, for a price of $10-15, well worth it.Would I gift it? Maybe, if someone planned on traveling internationally. Is it comfortable? It's okay, light weight though the band isn't the most comfortable. Is it quality material? The band is a cheap composite band, the watch itself is fine, about what you would expect for the price. Should you get this if you plan to travel? Unequivocally yes.Read more by Sean, Relógio simples, leve, bem construído e extremamente funcional.

Brand: Casio Men's Classic W800H-1AV Sport Watch with Black Resin Band, Model: Casio Men's Classic W800H-1AV Sport Watch with Black Resin Band, Price: 19, Material: Resin, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Bought this 2 years and 8 months ago and it's still great. In that time, it's drifted 27 seconds (e.g. at 8:00:00 it now reads 8:00:27). **EDIT** This drift is inaccurate. Updated at bottom of review **END EDIT**. For me, that's not a big deal, but figured I'd mention it. I wear the watch face-side down on my wrist, but it only accrued one mild scratch in all that time. Nothing terrible. I bought this watch because it had 3 things; the 24-hour time, the day of the week, and the date on a single screen. It's the only watch I've found that had all 3 of those. To find all 3 in a highly rated and CHEAP watch? I bought it in a second and haven't regretted it since. I actually returned a better and more expensive watch (Casio DW5600E-1V) before eventually finding and loving this. I especially love that it orders the date in Year-Month-Day format. I live in the US where Month-Day-Year is the norm, but I also work with thousands of computer files where the best way to organize files by date is with a Year-Month-Day system (e.g. 221102 for November 2, 2022). It's just a little nothing thing, but I love this watch for it.I should note that the watch band snapped off back in August, 2 years and 5 months after getting the watch. That's happened with other watches with resin bands that I've owned, always around the 2-3 year mark. I heard it's from sweat or showers hardening the resin or something. That could make sense as I never take mine off except when I'm rock climbing. Regardless, I just grabbed a cheap 18mm silicone watch strap for 12.99 and it's been fine ever since (bought silicone because I heard they don't snap. I'll update this if it ever does).I plan to use this watch forever. If it breaks, I'll buy a new one for the price of a burger + onion rings. I've gone through a dozen watches over the past 25 years or so, but this is the first one that I loved. It has everything I want without a bunch of other useless expensive crap that I'll never use (looking at you, altimeter; and that's coming from a hiker). It's cheap, reliable (anecdotally), has a fast band replacement process, no feature-bloat, has large text, and is DECENTLY water resistant. The only downside is that the watch isn't 200m water resistant. If it was, it'd be perfect for me. Anyway, I don't go surfing/swimming with it, but it hasn't fogged up after 2+ years of showers, rain, sweat, etc. If you want a cheap watch, I recommend this one (unless you're an avid surfer). Or if you're like me and willing to fork over $100 for a watch, maybe buy this anyway. It's certainly much better than the $21 price-tag would have you believe.**EDIT** 12/12/23I made the above review over a year ago, but I realized that I couldn't verify that the 27 seconds of drift was accurate. Well, I decided to run a little experiment over the past year and record the drift every few months (basically whenever I remembered I was even doing this) and it turns out that the drift WASN'T accurate. After a year, my watch drifted 58 seconds. To get that 27 second value, I might have reset my watch whenever we had daylight saving time or something, hence the inaccurate drift. Anyway, I included the recorded values below (MM/DD/YY format) in case someone is interested. Also, I used time.gov for the baseline comparison.12/11/22  9:55PM - 0 seconds fast01/19/23  6:18PM - 5 seconds fast02/22/23  12:48PM - 10.5 seconds fast04/15/23  9:00PM - 18.5 seconds fast05/08/23  8:22PM - 22 seconds fast06/27/23  12:52PM - 30 seconds fast09/06/23  8:15PM - 41 seconds fast11/05/23  7:18PM - 51 seconds fast12/11/23  9:55PM - 58 seconds fastThis basically means my watch drifts by a little more than 1 second every week (1sec/~6.29days). For my needs, that's fine. I'm not doing anything in my daily life that requires long-term precision to the second, and I have to reset it every so often anyway for the aforementioned daylight saving time, so I don't mind at all. Other than that, the watch still works great (nearing 4 years now) and the "new" silicone watchband is still great too (although it hasn't hit that 2-3 year breakdown point yet). So, all in all, still happy with it.Read more by onwa, I have been using this for a few weeks. I've done a couple hikes that included cliff jumping, climbing, and water for multiple hours. I took it scuba diving for two days and we were in the ocean constantly. It held up perfectly. I dove for two days averaging 30-40 feet deep but 65 at the deepest. It did great for all of that. I used the stopwatch underwater multiple times. The display is crisp and clear. Buttons are perfect size. Easy to push even with scuba gloves but they don't dig into your wrist. The light works great. It doesn't stay on for more than a second unless you hold it but I like that. Less battery wasting. The strap is a little long. I have small wrists so I cut it shorter. I regretted that in a thick 7ml wetsuit when the long strap would have been nice, but it still worked. I've seen others exhange the straps. The alarm is enough to wake up with. It beeps 10 times and then stops. It will go again every 5 minutes if you have the snooze setting on. So far I have one tiny scratch on the surface. Only noticeable if you really look for it. That's pretty good for the abuse I've already put it through. My favorite part about it is that it replaces having to get my phone out or turned on for time, stopwatch, and alarm while I'm backpacking/hiking/diving. People think that you need to have expensive gear to have fun outside and that's usually not true.Read more by Amazon Customer, Easy to set, light weight, inexpensive, durable.Read more by Karl Winneker, UPDATED AT THE END***This Casio rocks.  I read up on watches for a few weeks (yes, I'm neurotic like that) before purchasing.  Even checking out $120 Seiko Automatic watches, et cetera.  I settled on this digital watch because it is a die-hard, long-lasting, easy-to-use, and easy-to-read watch.A few months later?  I am stoked!Let's address the elephant in the room first:  The lens scratches easily.  Yes and No.  It does get scratched when I bang it hard against drywall or concrete while I'm working.  But it is SUPER easy to fix.  I just put a dab of toothpaste on a cloth and rub it against the lens for a few seconds, then rinse it under water.  The scratch is gone.  I've done this twice now and the watch looks brand new.The display is bright at night.  The alarm wakes me up.  The watch itself has only gained 2 seconds over the course of 3 months (I check it against an atomic clock everyday at work.)I would recommend this watch to anybody that isn't too proud to rock a durable little digital wristwatch.  The display is amazing:  Show the name of the day, full date, time (including seconds), as well as whether the alarm, snooze, and signal modes are activated.  Comfortable band, doesn't get smelly like leather.I have HUGE wrists.  I'm 6' 3" and have large hands and this watch fits me great.  Could easily tighten up several notches for people with normal sized wrists.It's not that classy looking, but it is a tank.  I feel naked if I leave the house without it now.  Just like my pocketknife.***UPDATED***Band is crap.  Time piece is still great.  About 2 years after purchasing the band completely fell apart.  I kept it together with super glue and electrical tape for about the last 6 month's of the band's life.  It cracked and split A LOT.  The watch itself will last for years, but not on my wrist, unfortunately.  It is cheaper to buy another watch than to get a replacement band.  Is this what economists refer to as Planned Obsolescence?***Another update:  after 3 years the barn is toast again.  I will keep buying this watch.  I'm in love with this model.  I have no doubt the timepiece will last for the full ten years as advertised.  The bands are 3 years tops.  I still have my older watches from years past relegated to backpacks and glove boxes.Read more by Lester Burnham, Good quality, many uses, easy to use, lightweight, comfortableRead more by William.
Brand: Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watch, Model: Invicta Men's Pro Diver Collection Coin-Edge Automatic Watch, Price: 82, Material: Stainless-steel, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: Frankly, I was somewhat skeptical. A decent, let alone good, watch at this price from ... ahem ... Invicta? Well, my experience 2 weeks or so into ownership has pretty much proven my suspicions to be ill-founded. This is a terrific watch, made all the better because of the "silly" price. Pay 20x the money or much more, if you want, in terms of a quality watch, you won't do better. OK, it doesn't say Omega or Rolex on the dial. But, let me take you through my likes and dislikes.1. Appearance.It looks terrific straight out of the case and appears to be well made. On my wrist, I think it looks great -- it's 40mm, ie, medium sized these days, and that suits me.2. Feel.It has a surprising heft. I wasn't expecting this for a watch at this price-point, but it feels substantial, but not overly heavy, when wearing it.  I like that very much -- it's reassuring, somehow, and suggests robustness and superior build quality to my way of thinking.3. Durability.Too soon to tell, overall, However, when I accidentally banged the watch against a heavy metal gate the other day, I winced, fully expecting to find at least a cracked or scratched crystal, or damage to the strap. Nope. Nada. I wasn't just relieved, I was, again, very pleasantly surprised by this piece.4. Reliability.Again, probably too early to say, overall. Again, however, I will say this: my watch has been keeping perfect time. Saying so here will now probably jinx it, but we shall see. I was not expecting this from my own prior experience with an automatic watch, and some of the other reviews here. It wouldn't have bothered me too much, as I viewed time gain/loss as part of the automatic watch experience -- and I like to engage with my devices. Sort of like preferring to drive stick over automatic. It's a personal thing. But, so far, this watch has kept perfect time.5. Automatic movement.I just prefer it to quartz, although quartz is, typically, just perfectly accurate. I didn't want to see the word "quartz" on the dial, and I liked seeing the watch-movement on the back of the case. That movement, however, is painted yellow, not left stainless. Initially, I was put off by this because I just didn't like the aesthetic. However, I almost never see it as the watch is on my wrist all the time, and now I've become used to it anyway.6. Service.This also really surprised me. I took delivery of the watch and followed the instructions (or so I thought) to set both the time and the date. Problem: time re-set ok, but not the date, no matter how often I tried. I was disappointed and annoyed with myself. After all, at this price-point, what could I expect? So, I waited 24 hours and was advised I could either get a complete refund or a replacement. If io ted for the replacement, i would have 30 days to return the original, or else my card would be charged again. I opted for the replacement, which arrived a few days later. Again, I was unable to set the date, although the setting the time went flawlessly. Again I was frustrated, but also skeptical of the possibility that not one but two watches had the identical issue. Perhaps the problem wasn't with the watch, but with me -- perhaps I was doing something wrong? I took them to a nearby jeweler/Invicta dealer, who showed me that, yes indeed, the problem was me. When setting the date, even though you are going forward, you have to wind backwards, ie, counter-clockwise. Problem solved! I therefore returned the replacement watch and kept the original. Yes, the instructions in the box could have been clearer, but I was mightily impressed by the Seller (Amazon?) immediately sending me a replacement with no questions asked, and then giving me 30 days to return the original before charging my card.7. The"unboxing" experience.People post YouTube videos of themselves unboxing their latest doo-dad all the time. Certainly, there is something satisfying about unboxing your new iProduct or Cartier that adds to the whole ownership experience. This, for me, was not that. The box is a horrible vinyl. The yellow color isn't exactly subtle, but would probably look better in cardboard. I don't keep it out anywhere visible. The instructions are stuffed into the lid and don't fit. It all looks and feels wrong. The watch itself was covered in a number of transparent protective tapes, that were tricky to remove and required some patience. All that said, none of these (minor) gripes have affected my overall, very positive experience.8. Value For Money.You could get yourself the quartz version for about $30 cheaper at the time of writing. While that's not nothing, and is about a full one-third less than this watch, I opted for this model. The quartz model also has a slightly different bezel, one which I actually prefer as it's a little more modern and subtle, without the classic, jagged "teeth." This watch has the traditional look. However, for me, an automatic stainless-steel diver's watch with these looks, heft and reliability at this price, represents excellent VFM.9.Conclusion.If you're considering this watch, I say buy it. It's very reasonably priced for what it is and you'll have ample time to return it if you don't like it.Read more by Mr. Manalyst, This has been my first automatic type watch purchase. I refused to dive head first into purchasing, what could be considered a "higher end" brand as my first automatic. Examples include citizens (eco-drive), Seiko, Movado (I have one non-automatic), Bulova (I have two non-automatic) and so on. I'm pinching pennies as it is with the economy as it is. What does someone do when they want a watch for a price that won't break the bank, looks nice, functions well, and you can see yourself wearing it frequently?I rarely wear my Movado or Bulova's - matter of fact, I put those in a safe years ago. I only wore them with business suites etc. As daily wear watches, I've bought throw aways over the years. Casio digital watch, timex, no brand names and hell, even a smart watch (which I rarely used to it's full purpose)Enter the Invicta Pro Diver**Pros**- Watch Feels Solid - The band feels like good construction and so does the watch- Band is not loud - I can't really describe what I mean by this but some watch band links "cling" togetherwhen you move or the watch moves. Like it's cheap and loose. Not this band. It's solid.- Looks great - The colors on the band, dial, and so on really pop- Keeping good time - It arrived active already - I set the time last night, right to the second, and so far it's right on the money (I used my desktops windows time to nail the seconds down)- Higher end movement - I did a lot of research on the Seiko movement (NH35A) and according to some online sources, this is a 40.00 dollar movement by itself.- Water Resistance - I was looking forward to having a watch I could wear at all times. Even in the shower. Something as trivial as needing to take a watch off to shower and put back on after is annoying. I showered with it and (**important** make sure the crown is screwed down and tight to turn clockwise) I have no issues to report**Cons**- Clasp Quality - The clasp feels solid for the most part. I could foresee it wearing down over time. Kind of why I've decided to rarely, if ever, take off the watch. I'm not too worried about this.- Does not glow in the dark very well - I don't really know much about the science behind luminous but I can tell you that I'm simply not able to tell the time in the dark. It does glow but not bright enough in my opinion.- Invicta Branding - Some may have no issue with having an "Invicta" engraving on the bezel and the Invicta symbol on the second hand. Some may find that tacky. I personally don't really care.**Take Away**I'm happy with my purchase. I paid 74 bucks (I'm including taxes etc. in that price) for an automatic watch that functions well, looks great, is solid built, and will accomplish what I had as an end goal for buying my first automatic watch. Time will tell (pun intended) how well this watch holds up. I'm not a very daily active person. Meaning I work in an office setting. Not much going on that could cause any sort of issue for the watch. I am active during the week and on the weekends going to the gym etc. I plan on wearing the watch throughout all of those activities. I'll definitely be putting the watch through its paces.If you're just getting into the automatic side of watches, in a market saturated by countless brands mimicking other brands, and where a decent name "high end brand" starts at 150.00 (for really bottom barrel automatics) , to better looking name brand watches priced 300.00 to 500.00 , and you're wanting to save a buck, I think you'll be happy buying this watch.It checked most if not all my checkboxes. For the price and movement quality, you simply can't beat it.Read more by Laxluver1234, This is a solid well made time piece.Looks great, and feels good on my wrist.Really accurate keeping time, no issues.Well worth the price!!!Read more by Karl, Invicta gets a lot of hate from the watch community, but if you’re looking to get into automatic movements at a super affordable price this is the watch for you!Overall the watch is pretty solid at this price point, but there is some quality control issues to be aware of. Upon delivery the bezel of my watch was loose and would rotate a full click clockwise even though it’s supposed to be unidirectional, so that’s an issue I’ll need to fix.The screw down crown works well and easily adjusts the time and date window.The bracelet is relatively solid, but doesn’t feel like the highest quality, which will be an aspect of this watch you may look to replace.The movement is the ever reliable NH35A from Seiko and there are no complaints to be had regarding the movement. It’s a work horse and will absolutely get the job done for years to come.It’s a nice looking watch and is comparable in style to the Rolex Submariner. It will look good on wrist, and if taken care of can last quite some time!It was delivered in a hard shell plastic case and came with 2 silica packets to keep any moisture from becoming an issue in transit. Plastic wrapped to avoid any scratches as well.Read more by Joehl Crawford-Robinson, Muy buena compra funciona súper bien y se ve muy bien también reloj versatilRead more by Héctor perez.
Brand: Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Garrison Field Watch in Stainless Steel with Olive Nylon strap, Black Dial (Model: BM8180-03E), Model: Citizen Men's Eco-Drive Weekender Garrison Field Watch in Stainless Steel with Olive Nylon strap, Black Dial (Model: BM8180-03E), Price: 187, Material: Unknown, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: A year or two ago I bought a watch from Amazon when it was on sale for 1/2  price. It was a dandy watch, worked perfect, but it was *huge*, and pretty  heavy. It was also pretty flashy, and I'm  not. So I wound up only wearing it for "dressy" times, e.g., like church.  Finally, the battery died, and I decided I didn't like the watch well enough to go to the expense of buying a new battery and the hassle of putting it in.So I decided I would buy a new watch that (1) wasn't as big, heavy, and flashy as this one, and (2) didn't have a battery - I hate messing with batteries. So  I started researching watches, and when the next Amazon watch sale came along, I found a lovely *automatic*  (we called it "self-winding" in the "old days") Seiko in the "military-inspired" minimalist style was that I was looking for. I *almost* bought it, but the rating was a flat 4.0/5, and there were enough negative reviews about stopping working and other problems that it gave me pause. In addition, I doubted that a self-winding watch would work reliably for someone like me who doesn't wear a watch all the time.So I did some more research, and discovered that there was a 3rd class of watches - solar-powered!! And the "solar" supposedly means any kind of light. I found this Citizen watch that looked almost exactly like the Seiko that I liked and almost bought. It was about 85 bucks, which seemed reasonable, esp. for a watch that didn't require me to buy a battery or even to walk around...lolI've had this watch for about 32 days now. I love the look, and it is keeping perfect time. I still only wear it when I go out (i.e., not around the house),  and I've been leaving it in the kitchen where there is usually natural light during the day, plus bright artificial light on and off. So far it has worked fine. I did have to charge it under bright light for something like 12-15 hours initially, so I just left the kitchen light on overnight. I suppose some would say that cost me maybe a  quarter, but I can live with that.The strap is of decent  quality, albeit a bit stiff (I'm sure that would have loosened up with wear),  but I just didn't like having to futz with securing the strap ever time I put it on (yes, I'm old and set in my ways). This was solved by one of the major life lessons I got from my dad. Along with teaching me how to determine the model year for 50s and 60s Fords and Chevys (back when they *didn't* all look alike, and when unveiling the new model Chevy was an actual event in my small town), and warning me to "never buy a used car, you're just buying somebody else's problems", my dad introduced me to the Spiedel Twist-O-Flex watch band. When he bought me my first watch when  I was around 12, the first thing we did was take off the band that came with it and replace it with a brand-new Twist-O-Flex (yes, we had to take out several links to get it to fit my thin young wrist). Heck, I didn't even know you could take the band off a watch, much less change its size !!! This watch has an 18mm aperture (or w/e you call it where the band attaches), and an 18mm Twist-O-Flex fits it perfectly.The only negative would be the dearth of documentation. Other than a little folder with a few lines in about 30 languages, I was referred to a web site for info on charging and setting, etc. This is standard in the 21st century, but it still chaps me a bit.I won't apologize for the length of this review. This is the kind of review I like to find when I am considering buying an item, so this is just "do unto others" for me.Keep it up, Jeff B., you are doing a great job !!!P.S. I added a couple of pics with the new band, mainly to practice with my new Kindle Fire...:)Read more by JaggedOne, After looking at almost 100 watches on Amazon, and closely at 6, I chose the Citizen Eco-Drive BM8180 because it met, and exceeded, the adjectives I applied to it in this review's title. I closely considered the similar Eco-Drive field chronograph, 2 Seikos (both 'field' styled, and both automatics), a Bulova, a Stuhrling, and an Invicta. It is the Citizen BM8180 for me (I have had the BM8180 for almost two months now), for these reasons, and in despite the one caveat:*Traditional materials & old-fashioned proven design. A solid steel case and back, and glass/mineral crystal, along with the 'plain' black dial and simple numerals. Details like the crown guards and a claw-screw back emphasize a handsome, well-made timepiece. Also carries a 5-year parts & labor warranty (and a 20-year warranty on the 'power cell').*Eco-Drive: no batteries, no 'winding' dependent on how active I am (and automatics all deviate at least 1 minute plus per month below the $400 and up range). Solar-powered quartz movement, so just "set it & forget it." I am a bit nocturnal, so to be on the safe side I set the watch on the windowsill for an hour of mostly direct sun once a week, which should keep it fully topped off at all times. Any source of artificial light is also fine (incandescent, fluorescent, halogen, even a REALLY large candelabra will do it!).*Feels great and very substantial in my hand, on my wrist, and when setting.*A very good, known maker, and at a price so low I want to tell people I paid MORE (I paid $81US, March 2010)!*And more than a little: a remarkably high & consistent rating on Amazon. It is indeed very rare to see any item on Amazon receive such high marks and comments, with so few negatives, over such a long period of time. I have been an Amazon customer since 1998 and bought watches, cameras, computer equipment, pens, books, CDs, DVDs, audio equipment, flashlights, small hand tools, luggage, and who knows what else, and I can't remember another item that so nearly universally gave it's purchasers here such a strong positive experience.*Setting the watch is easy, straightforward, and mostly intuitive, except for the warning not to set day/date between 9pm and 4am, which has to do with mechanical workings internally, and is not any inconvenience. A few people have not read either the Amazon product page or any of Citizen documentation, and have damaged their timepieces. So just don't be an impatient dope.*The only caveat or negative I'd offer I don't find an issue, myself. The band is tightly-woven OD green canvas with a sewn black leather backing (another mark of quality old-school manufacture). The solid steel grommets are large. It is stiff at first. After 2 weeks it loosened and lengthened about 3mm. I have pretty thick wrists and I am on hole 2, even 3 on some days. It is a good looking, substantial band. I like it.*All the other things: it keeps good time, losing just slightly more than 1 second in 9 weeks, which makes it 5-6 seconds deviant a YEAR. There is no backlight, but the hands glow legibly for 30 minutes or more after lights out. It is perfectly silent, even pressed tightly to my ear. The day function reads out alternatively in spanish, if you like or need it to. The requirements for light recharge are modest and will be easy to meet or exceeded by nearly everyone who wears this watch. 100 meter water resistance, which will be retained, unlike watches that must be opened every 2-3 years to replace the battery, thus ruining their real water resistance unless repacked by a pro for $$. The Citizen docs are clear, easy to read, and extensive.All in all, I give this watch an unreserved strong recommendation, a 5-star item for certain. I was prepared to hate the band and replace it right away, and the BM8180 would still have been a 4+ star. So for a handsome, solid, dependable, and inexpensive watch, you can't go wrong here.Read more by W. White, Muito bom produto, recomendo.Read more by Antonio Vieira, I would have liked it to be a bit bigger, but I took it with me on a hunting trip and found it to be the perfect watch. Many hunters prefer digital watches, but these often emit beeps from time to time. With this watch, the time is clear, and as a bonus, you can use it as a compass if you take the time to learn how (as with any analog watch). I love the color of the wristband, which is why it is my go-to watch for field trips. Citizen is a very good brand, even though it is underrated by some. I have some of their classic watches, which are good starters for a collection, but this one is truly my favorite (Citizen). Unless you're in a war zone and need a Rolex that you can trade with the locals in an emergency (as special operation troops apparently do), this is a great watch for the average guy, especially when you're outdoors, particularly hunting. It is quite efficient and looks dapper.Read more by Alexandre Martel, Just love the simpleness in the design yet gives the watch a handsome look.It's one year and running great.

Brand: Anne Klein Women's Date Function Bracelet Watch, Model: Anne Klein Women's Date Function Bracelet Watch, Price: 25, Material: Metal, Water Resistance: False, Rating: 5.0. Reviews: This watch is exactly what I was looking for. I have a very small wrist and I didn't want a ridiculous large face watch. This has a face no larger than a penny and looks feminine. I did have to have it sized smaller though because it still was a bit large. Now that it’s fixed it’s beautiful.Read more by Michelle C., Perfect to replace a similar watch thathas become worn and scratched.  It came ready-to-go with the time all set.

Was already set to proper time, and keeps the correct time.Read more by Kat, I have a somewhat petite wrist, and while this watch is slightly oversized on me, I appreciate its bracelet-style aesthetic. I'm confident that it can be adjusted to fit snugly if necessary. In my search for a timepiece, I aimed for something simple, elegant, and budget-friendly with a touch of femininity, and this watch ticks all the boxes for me. I particularly adore the blend of metals, as it complements any jewelry I choose to pair it with. Additionally, the inclusion of a date display adds practicality to its charm, enhancing its functionality for everyday wear.Read more by Gabriela.

Reviews: I really like the large display that’s very easy to read outside. The band stays locked extremely well. The band has a sleek design. The light button is on the right side but otherwise I love it. I’m super impressed with the fit and quality. I tried the discounted returned item and it was perfect. The box was a little banged up and the instructions were missing but for $6 less than regular price I think it was worth it. I’m so glad I found another water resistant watch. Buy it, you’ll love it.Read more by Jimmer- J, I loooooooove this little gadget so much. The day after I bought the watch, they put it on SALE!!! I almost bought another one because, for $13 (sale price), you get a sturdy, stylish watch that is easy to use and reprogram.The watch is also water-resistant. I wash a lot of dishes lol so it's really nice not to have to fiddle with my watch every time I have to put my hands under water! It's been about 3 weeks since I bought the watch, and it's really helped me at work with managing my time, and I love how many modes this little watch has. It has a spot for a second time zone, an alarm that beeps at you a few times when it goes off, and a stop watch, and if you press the ST/STP (start/stop) button, you'll be able to see the month, day, and year. Super great purchase!Read more by Ale Alvarez, I purchased this watch in the middle of a summer camp season in 2022 after my 15-year-old Timex sports watch (Yes, 15 years old—so old that the model is no longer made) finally gave up the ghost. With its predecessor having survived everything from water to mud to bicycle crashes, I had high expectations for this one.So far everything is going well. The watch does have a 24 hour mode, which is essential for me, as well as an alarm, water resistance, and an attractive gold-coloured face plate. It has survived everything I have thrown at it so far, from waterskiing to 100-degree heat, to washing dishes in a commercial kitchen. Armitron got all the most important stuff right even in a shrinking market; the reason I did not give this a 5 star review was that this watch does have a few odd quirks that I have detailed belowPros:Excellent priceReasonably stylishSmall, compact and light weightWater resistant (this does not mean fully waterproof; do NOT press the buttons underwater)24 hour time and a serviceable backlightShows no signs of wear even after 4 months heavy use.Cons:Display lacks some contrast compared to my old TimexWhile it allows you to set the year in its date readout, it does not do daylight savings time automatically—somewhat puzzling because I thought that was the point of setting the year.Cannot figure out how to swap the T2 auxiliary time zone into my primary time zoneNo count-down timerWhile the faceplate is gold, the band clip is silver. This is unimportant if you buy a silver one.The lettering on the front that reads “Armitron WR 330M” faded away within 4 days.Not quite as accurate as my old Timex—I lose about 1 minute per month, which is just okUpdate, April 2, 2023: About 8 months later, and still going strong. The plastic watch face is proving to be more scratch resistant than my previous Timex, and I still feel that the watch is presentable outside of work.Read more by E. Jo, I bought a few sports watches and just happened to have ordered this one in a mix. Once I worked my way to wearing it, I loved it from the moment I put it on!!I've really active and have worn a sports watch 24/7 for nearly 25 years. When I dress up for a nice dinner, party or formal occassion, I struggle with finding the right watch that hides the noticeable tan line on my wrist, but still looks classy.For an inexpensive sports watch, this one looks fabulous for a night out in a dress! I've already had two friends notice it, and when I show them what I'm wearing they are shocked at how nice it looks.It's the perfect size and has all of the functions I need in a sports watch. I ordered two more so I have plenty of backups for a long time :)Read more by Jill Currey Shermer, Needed a waterproof watch for lake days.  This is perfect.  Ive been wearing it for a few years now and its still working great!  I can be in the lake all day just floating and it never skips a beat.Read more by Leah Thowson.

Great value for the price.Read more by Amazon Customer, I divorced my ex after 24 years of marriage... he had bought me a nice watch, something over $100... before the ink could dry on the paper that watch was donated to the local Good Will, a smile of freedom set upon my face as I drove away. There were multiple items I dropped off that beautiful autumn day. My adventures were only to begin.I bought my first watch, something small and dainty. Only to wear it out after a couple of years, it looked battered and broken, much like the changes I have gone through.  Yet, as I realize daily that change is a constant in life I too must make changes.In purchasing a new watch I read reviews,  considered what I liked in color and  style.  This watch has met all expectations.  The color is beautiful,  it's elegant and looks great with everything.  It's not heavy, and the clasp is not loose nor difficult to open.  I appreciate the compliments I have received,  it's nice to be noticed for the good things.Read more by Yvonne Ray, This watch is pretty but the adage you get what you pay for is definitely true. I would not wear this as an everyday watch. I think it might turn green or the coating/color would wear off. However, I bought it to wear once in a while when I wear rose gold jewelry. It is the quality of the jewelry you see in Macy’s on the center aisle tables in boxes during the holidays. I’m keeping it because that was what I expected.Read more by Goody2Shoes, My sister loves it! It looks so elegant that she's scared to use it everyday at school and in public haha. It's not bulky and heavy. My sister loves wearing it. We had to go to a watch shop though to get it readjusted but nevertheless, I think it's a worth buy :)Read more by Joanna Nipal.
